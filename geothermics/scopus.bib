Heat pumps are the example of the key technology, which could help to achieve the aim by heating, cooling and domestic hot water (DHW) preparation in an ecological and energy-efficient way. This article characterized a heat pump market in Europe between 2009 and 2020 with a special regard to France, Spain, Poland and Lithuania, for which a more detailed study was presented. The analysis was performed primarily on the grounds of statistics data provided by the European Heat Pump Association (EHPA), which determined the number of heat pumps sold based on standard questionnaires from national heat pump associations, statistical offices and research institutes. The highest number of heat pump sold in analysed period of time was recorded in France, Italy, Sweden, Norway, Germany and Spain. Poland was in the middle of the list, while Lithuania was one of the last countries. Considering the number of heat pumps sold per 1000 households, Norway was the clear leader, followed by Estonia, Finland, Sweden and Denmark. Lithuania was placed 12th, while Poland was only 18th. In terms of the type of lower and upper heat source, air-to-water and air-to-air heat pumps were the most popular choices, while ground source heat pumps were the least popular. The development of the heat pump market has been influenced by social, environmental, economic and technological factors.  © 2021 Agata Witkowska et al., published by Sciendo.},

	abstract = {In this study, a CuS with a flower ball shape was synthesized and loaded onto cotton yarn to develop a photosensitive interfacial material with excellent photothermal conversion properties. Four composite phase change materials were prepared by compounding different ratios of expanded graphite (EG) with 1-octadecanol (OC). Finally, four sandwich-shaped photothermal CPCMs with different parameters (6 wt%EG-OC, 12 wt%EG-OC, 18 wt%EG-OC and 24 wt%EG-OC) were prepared by constant pressure molding with cotton yarn loaded with CuS as the outer layer and expanded graphite-octadecane as the sandwich layer. As a safe and stable low-temperature phase change material, OC has great potential for applications such as energy saving in buildings, domestic hot water supply and body heat management. The photothermal CPCMs developed in this study have good thermal storage performance, photothermal conversion efficiency, and thermal stability. The experimental results showed that the enthalpy of melting of 6 wt% EG-OC was 337.8 J/g, the thermal conductivity of solid 24 wt% EG-OC could reach 3.43 W·m−1·K−1, and the photothermal conversion efficiency of 24 wt% EG-OC was 75.92%. A typical daily amount of solar radiation can be stored using 27.19 g (58.01 m3) of 18 wt% EG-OC.

	abstract = {Geothermal energy comes in many different forms depending on the specific conditions of the resource. For example, in volcanic areas (such as the Canary Islands) or with subduction of tectonic plates, deposits of water/steam of very high energy and temperatures (150°–350 °C) are sometimes produced, known as high enthalpy resources. Due to their high quality, these can be used for electricity production in binary cycles. The design of a geothermal heat pump system to replace conventional cæold and heat production systems in a winery on the island of Lanzarote (Canary Islands, Spain) is presented. First, a calculation system based on the Matlab program was designed to review the influences of the winemaker’s decisions on the cold and heat consumption of the winery. After calculating hot and cold water consumption and heat pump requirements, a field of geothermal probes was designed using available software. Subsequently, the dimensions of the liquid impulsion equipment were estimated, and an electrical installation was created for the whole system. The data considered are related to winery logistics, must properties, environment, tank dimensions, and energy needs (cooling and heating). Finally, it was decided to use a reversible heat pump with exhaust heat recovery. This system allows heat extracted by the cooling system to be partly used to produce hot water instead of all of it being discharged to the ground. The cooling system will be operated for 18 h daily as a design criterion. The pump selected for the final project installed has an exhaust heat recovery system that allows domestic hot water to be produced in cooling mode. Hot water generation, when the heat pump is cooling, is 15 kW, and the temperature provided is 60 °C, which is adequate to meet the hot water needs of the winery. In addition, the heat pump’s heat sink is in the ground, which remains in practically constant conditions throughout the year, so the effect of outside temperature is minimized. In general, the main advantages of installing a geothermal system are energy savings and reduction in CO2 emissions. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {In order to achieve the carbon peak and carbon neutrality strategy in China, A SAGSHP (solar-assisted ground source heat pump) system is developed and four partition operation schemes of quarterly multi-mode switching buried pipe were designed in this research. Four types of buried pipe interconnection were schemed including central type, N type, H type, diagonal type, and the field tests were conducted. The system performance, soil heat balance, economic characteristics of the SAGSHP system were analyzed and compared with the ASHP&CFB (Air source heat pump & Coal-fired boiler) system. The results show that the energy supply by the SAGSHP system can meet the heating, cooling and domestic hot water needs of separated buildings after adopting the partitioned multi-mode switching operation scheme. Meanwhile, the system's heat loss is decreased, soil heat balance is well maintained, and the system flexibility is improved. The graded use of solar and soil energy is well realized. The COPs of SAGSHP system in heating period and cooling period were 3.62 and 5.76 respectively under the control of the central zoning operation scheme of buried pipes. Solar energy can provide 49.97 % of the total heat supply of the system. Compared with the ASHP&CFB system, the SAGSHP system can save 9.84 t of standard coal after operating 13 years, and the equivalent reductions of CO2, SO2, and dust are 26.568 t, 0.1968 t, and 0.1476 t, respectively. The system economy is the most sensitive to the project's initial cost whereas the least sensitive to electricity prices.

The main aim is to assess the potential of ground regeneration and reduction of CO2 emission by passive cooling application. The study adds value to similar research conducted worldwide for various conditions. The behavior of the lower source of the heat pump was simulated using EED software. The ground and borehole properties, heat pump characteristics, heating and cooling load, as well as the energy demand for domestic hot water preparation have been used as input data. Based on the brine temperatures for all analyzed cases including the ground with lower and higher values of conductivity and heat capacity, the borehole filler of inferior and superior thermal properties, and the passive cooling option turned on and off, the seasonal efficiencies of the heat pump have been calculated. The energy and emission savings calculations are based on the values obtained. The application of passive cooling reduces the brine temperature drop by 0.5 K to over 1.0 K in consecutive years in the analyzed cases and the thermal imbalance by 65.0% to 65.9%. Electric energy savings for heating and domestic hot water preparation reach 4.5%, but the greatest advantage of the system is the possibility of almost emission-free colling the living spaces which allows reducing around 33.7 GWh of electric energy and 1186–1830 kg of CO2 emission for cooling. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Geothermal energy is one of the most promising renewable energy. In order to improve the overall utilization degree of medium-and-high temperature geothermal water by flash cycle, a new combined heating and power system is proposed to provide electricity and domestic hot water at the same time. This new system is integrated by single-stage flash cycle and ammonia-water absorption heat pump cycle, of which the heat pump cycle recovers two streams of waste heat of the flash cycle, including the waste heat of the turbine exhaust steam and the geofluid drained from the flasher. The mathematical models of the new system is established at length in this article, and a numerical simulation is conducted to present the preliminary design condition. The simulation results show that the thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency of the system could reach 81.8% and 46.99% respectively under the condition of 170℃ geothermal water. Then a thermodynamic parameter analysis is carried out to explore the impact of five key thermodynamic parameters on the system performance. The results show that an optimal flash pressure happens to make the system exergy efficiency maximal, and there is a similar case for the generator temperature. Within some certain value ranges, a higher rectification column pressure brings about a sharp drop in the exergy efficiency, whereas a higher ammonia concentration of ammonia-strong solution leads to the exergy efficiency rising. Additionally a higher evaporation pressure just has slightly positive effect on the exergy efficiency. Finally an optimization and comparison study is implemented between the proposed system and four flash cycle based combined systems, and the optimization results indicate that the proposed system has a better performance no matter from the viewpoint of the first law or the second law of thermodynamics. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Improvements for islands sustainability subjected to strong anthropogenic pressures could be obtained by innovative solutions for energy supply by using local energy renewable sources. This paper analyses the possible benefits of a geothermal energy community, consisting of residential users, located in Ischia, an island of Naples in South of Italy. The proposed system is mainly based on an Organic Rankine Cycle plant interacting with a medium temperature geothermal source. This system satisfies both community's pure electric load and electricity requests of the electric-driven heat pumps for space conditioning and domestic hot water demands. The entire system and residential users were modelled and dynamically simulated by considering hourly electric, thermal/cooling and domestic hot water loads variation during three reference days for winter, summer and intermediate season. The proposed plant was compared to a traditional system in which the electricity to meet the total community's electric loads, is taken from the national power grid. The results highlight that the use of proposed system instead of traditional one allows to avoid 29.9 tons per year of CO2 emissions. Furthermore, this proposed system ensures the island-operation of community exploiting local renewable energy source and improving the energy independency. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

A water-to-water heat pump system is integrated with solar thermal collectors, vertical boreholes, and horizontal underground loops buried in a partially-insulated, confined underground region beneath the buildingfoundation. Heating is provided through a floor radiant system, and cool air is supplied to each conditioned space through air handlers using the heat pump as the primary cooling source. Solar heat collected will first satisfy the heating requirements of the Domestic Hot Water (DHW) and floor radiant systems (for free space heating) in heating seasons. Excessive solar heat, if left over, will then be transferred into ageothermal buffer storage tank that is connected with the underground loop to allow for long-term or seasonal thermal energy storage in the underground regions of earth around and below the underground loops. When heating is needed by the floor radiant system, the heat pump will extract heat at its source side from either the geothermal buffer storage tank or the vertical boreholes, whichever can give a higher outlet water temperature. The horizontal underground loops, known as Thermal Battery, will be used to charge the geothermal buffer tank if the temperature of the tank is lower than a set point. This enables to maximize the system efficiency for space heating in winter, which is more critical for this heating-dominated building located in a cold climate region such as Michigan. This proposed system was modeled numerically with a series of simulations, whose results show that more than 20% energy savings can be achieved for the heat pump heating when comparing the proposed system and a conventional Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP) system without using the horizontal underground loops as a heat storage element. The results also demonstrate the feasibility of using this type of MSHP system to achieve more energy savings as well as the importance of optimizing the control strategy. For example, this study indicates that a more than 10% difference in terms of heating energy usage is identified when looking at two control strategies, i.e., charging the underground region through the horizontal loops during the whole year or only charging it during summer. © 2019 ASHRAE.},

	abstract = {Space heating and domestic hot water account for a large portion of energy consumption in buildings. Direct expansion ground source heat pump (DX-GSHP) is a promising renewable energy technology to provide heat efficiently in a wide range of applications in buildings. Moreover, there is a renewed interest on CO2, which is a viable option to replace synthetic refrigerants with an environmentally friendly alternative, yet limited studies have examined the performance of a CO2 DX-GSHP for different heating applications in buildings. A transcritical DX-CO2 GSHP had been built, and a number of tests were carried out to evaluate the performance of such a system and the associated ground heat exchanger (GHE) for three heating applications in buildings. Those applications represent low to high water temperature demand. DX-CO2 GSHP demonstrated a better performance and a higher heating capacity in applications with lower temperature demand. The highest COP was around 4 when DX_GSHP provides heat to radiant floor heating systems. Moreover, the performance of the system was examined with different number of active boreholes. The results implied that there could be an optimum number of boreholes to provide the highest heating capacity. © 2020},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the techno-economic performance of installed renewable energy technologies in students' residences of Democritus University of Thrace, in Kimmeria, Xanthi, North Greece. The students' residences building complex includes eleven (11) buildings of total area of 14,819.09 m2 and accommodate 630 students. The RES technologies installed, include a hybrid solar thermal/biomass system for heating, cooling and domestic hot water of the students' residences buildings and one amphitheater, a geothermal heat pumps system for heating and cooling of a restaurant, an autonomous PV system and one small vertical axis wind turbine. The above interventions were accomplished under "REUNI" project that was funded by EEA and Norway Grants program - GR03-Renewable Energy Technologies. The present study elaborates the operational results of almost two years of the RES technologies installed and highlights their techno-economic performance, through analysis of the collected operational data. The building complex of the students' residences of DUTH in Kimmeria has managed to operate for its thermal and cooling energy demand with hundred per cent (100%) renewables throughout a year, resulting in significant energy costs and CO2 reduction. However, the operation and maintenance cost of the installed systems has been underestimated, resulting in increased number of days of unavailability. The results highlight the need to increase solar energy penetration, as well as the need for subsidy in order to compete with the fossil fuel technologies. The development of such systems that utilize renewable energy sources is considered as a priority for the increase of share of RES in the building sector. The experience from the operation of such system is valuable for the promotion of renewable energy in the built environment. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Strategic planning of future energy systems in a district is essential to fully exploit the benefits from sector coupling. In particular, new solutions may arise when a group of buildings is considered rather than individual buildings. Therefore, in order to identify optimal production and storage technologies within a district, new tools are needed. In this paper we present the open-source software framework optihood, which allows for multi-objective optimization and analysis of energy systems for neighborhoods. The tool assists researchers and, in a future stage, energy planners in the design of energy systems as well as in optimizing their operation strategy. After introducing the tool, its applicability is demonstrated with a case study, wherein we investigated the supply of a small neighborhood of four residential buildings with space heat, domestic hot water and electricity demands. The optimizer was allowed to consider heat pumps (geothermal/air-source), PV, batteries and hot water storage tanks as available technologies. We show comparisons between optimal solutions in terms of total annualized cost for the buildings considered (a) together as a group and (b) individually. © 2023 Institute of Physics Publishing.

	abstract = {In the present work, the operating results from an innovative, renewable, energy-based space-heating and domestic hot water (DHW) system are shown. The system used solar thermal energy as its primary source and was assisted by a shallow geothermal application in order to accommodate the space-heating and DHW needs of a domestic building in Austria. The system incorporated phase-change materials (PCMs) in specially designed containers to function as heat-storage modules and provide an energy storage capability for both the space-heating and DHW subsystems. This system was designed, implemented, and tested under real operating conditions in a building for a period of one year. The operating and energy results for the system are demonstrated in this work. The system was compared with a conventional one, and a reduction in the primary energy consumption equal to 84.3% was achieved. The maintenance and operating costs of the system were reduced by 79.7% compared to the conventional system, thus significantly contributing to the NZEB target of the building. The newly proposed system, although presenting an increased operating complexity, utilizes an innovative self-learning control system that manages all of its operations. The combination of a solar thermal energy source with thermal energy storage increases the use of renewable energy by extending the capacity of the system beyond the solar hours and using excess solar energy for space-heating needs. The thermal energy storage unit also increases the energy and economic efficiency of the geothermal heat pump by operating it during the hours of a reduced electricity tariff and using the stored energy during hours of a high electricity demand. The cost for the installation of such a system is higher than a conventional one, but due to the significantly decreased operating costs, the pay-back period was calculated to be 8.7 years. © 2024 by the authors.},

These buildings were combined with a grid-connected electrified community. The community was primarily powered by building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems, and cooling and heating water were supplied by geothermal and hydrothermal source heat pump systems. The community building comprised 56 detached houses and two office buildings. The community’s primary electricity generation was provided by a 500 kWp BIPV, approximately 7.1 kWp installed per household. This community had facilities that provided cooling, heating, and domestic hot water from heat supply stations. Thermal energy for cooling and heating was mainly generated by geothermal and sewage water-source heat pumps, stored in a daily heat storage tank, and supplied to households. Based on the analysis using ISO 13790-based software, the cooling and heating requirements were 51 and 42 kWh/m2, respectively. The cooling and heating requirements were 49 and 44 kWh/m2, and a difference of approximately 5% between the simulation and experiment results was observed. Consequently, the annual zero-net energy balance was 138.2% when the plug load was excluded but 46.8% when the plug and electric-vehicle electricity loads were included. © 2023 Institute of Physics Publishing.

	abstract = {In this study, a PVT based solar assisted ground source heat pump (SAGSHP) system was investigated regarding its energy performance and cost-effectiveness for the city of Thessaloniki (Greece). The SAGSHP system was set to cover the space heating and domestic hot water needs for a low-rise dwelling. A mathematic model formulated in TRNSYS was used with the aim to carry out parametric analysis by varying the number of the PVTs. It is worth noting that, two of the most important components of the employed model, the PVT collector and the geothermal heat exchanger, have already been validated via experimental data. Simulations were conducted and through the results seven energy metrics were estimated, with the objective to examine the system's energy performance from various perspectives. The SAGSHP system with 16 PVTs was found capable to covering 73% of the heating load and to generate 1.22 times more electricity than that consumed by the system. The electricity yield of PVTs was not affected throughout the parametric analysis, and the maximum specific productivity was estimated at 301.5 kWhe PVT−1 per year. The results suggest that a SAGSHP system equipped with about 14 PVTs can reach energy self-sufficiency. As regards the economics of the SAGSHP system, this was compared with a natural gas boiler system via two methods, the life cycle cost (LCC) and the life cycle savings (LCS). A sensitivity analysis with major economic parameters of the systems was carried out. It was found that the cost-effectiveness of the SAGSHP system is influenced mainly by its capital cost and by the price of the natural gas. Systems equipped with less than 12 PVTs can be cost-competitive by subsiding from 8% up to 42% of their capital cost. Also, system with more than 12 collectors were found of more benefit than the smaller ones, in the case where feed-in-tariff schemes are applied, or the bank loan's interest rate is low. It can be concluded that, the proposed system can be an attractive monetary solution for covering the heating load in comparable dwellings with a similar climate to Thessaloniki. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The eco-district “Les Vergers”, located in Meyrin (Geneva, Switzerland), hosts around 1'350 dwellings and some activities. It is heated by a 5 MWth geothermal centralized heat pump. This study proposes a detailed analysis of the thermal demand of 23 selected buildings in this district as a representative panel of buildings meeting high swiss energy performance standards (Minergie A/P) and equipped with different heat recovery systems. Although the buildings have better thermal performance than the average buildings of Geneva, most show an important performance gap between the actual space heating demand and the design values. A strong correlation between performance gap and cut-off temperature of the heating system suggests that the regulation of the heat distribution system plays a determinant role in the overall performance. Regarding the domestic hot water preparation, the buildings of this district present an average demand 23% lower than the standard value and 31% lower than a benchmark. © Content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Licence.},

The system considered has an open-loop ground-water (aquifer) and an uncovered solar collector that can be used in a separate or connected in series topology. The refrigerant chosen for the heat pump was R290 (propane). This theoretical analysis was made using lumped models for each component of the system. The influence of ambient temperature, solar radiation, water well depth and ground water temperature in the COP, payback and collector efficiency were analyzed. The results showed that the COP of a Hybrid Source Heat Pump was better than other types of heat pump configurations for most environmental conditions, but the best payback was obtained using a Solar-Assisted Heat Pump. A case of study was performed for three different cities in Brazil and the paybacks found were in the range of 2.28 and 4.45 years. The results of COP and payback were compared with other papers and the maximum difference was 10% and 12%, respectively. Considering the scenario of a house that already has a water well, thereby eliminating the drilling cost, the best payback is obtained using a Ground-Source Heat Pump. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd and IIR},

	abstract = {An innovative thermal energy storage system (TESSe2b) was retrofitted in a residential building in Cyprus with a typical Mediterranean climate. The system comprises flat-plate solar collectors, thermal energy storage tanks filled with organic phase change material, a geothermal installation consisting of borehole heat exchangers with and without phase change material and a ground source heat pump, an advanced self-learning control system, backup devices and several other auxiliary components. The thermal energy storage tanks cover the building’s needs at certain temperature ranges (10–17◦ C for cooling, 38–45◦ C for heating and 50–60◦ C for domestic hot water). A performance evaluation was conducted by comparing the TESSe2b system with the existing conventional heating and cooling system. The systems were simulated using commercial software, and the performance of the systems and the building’s energy needs were calculated. Based on the energy quantities, an economic analysis followed. The equivalent annual primary energy consumption with the conventional system resulted in being 43335 kWh, while for the storage system, it was only 8398 kWh. The payback period for the storage system was calculated to be equal to 9.76 years. The operation of the installed storage system provided data for calculations of the seasonal performance factor and storage performance. The seasonal performance factor values were very high during June, July and August, since the TESSe2b system works very efficiently in cooling mode due to the very high temperatures that dominate in Cyprus. The measured stored thermal energy for cooling, heating and domestic hot water resulted in being 14.5, 21.9 and 6.2 kWh, respectively. Moreover, the total volume of the phase change material thermal energy storage tanks for heating and domestic hot water was calculated to be roughly several times smaller than the volume of a tank with water as a storage medium. © 2022 by the authors.

In this context, the REMOURBAN H2020 project has carried out a pilot deep refurbishing work on a small cluster of 10 homes, implementing energy saving measures and a hybrid energy-supply system to satisfy the heating and domestic hot water demand. The system aims to achieve near-zero-energy homes level of performance at reasonable cost by offsetting the energy consumption with local energy microgeneration. It is designed as a local low temperature district heating system and includes ground source heat pumps, photovoltaic panels, electric and thermal energy storage devices. The management of the complex hybrid system requires a suitable control strategy to optimise the energy consumption and consequently running cost. With this purpose a co-simulation tool has been developed, coupling a model of the energy system built using Dymola-Modelica and the EnergyPlus model of the buildings. This allows to develop different control strategies aiming to reduce the energy consumption from the grid, maximize the self-consumption of photovoltaic energy and ultimately move away from fossil fuel to sustainable energy resources. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

The Climate Road measures 50 m × 8 m × 1 m (length, width, depth, respectively) and has 800 m of geothermal piping embedded in the roadbed, serving as the heat collector for a GSHP that supplies a nearby kindergarten with domestic hot water and space heating. Model analysis of operational data from 2018–2021 indicates sustainable annual heat production levels of around 0.6 MWh per meter road, with a COP of 2.9–3.1. The continued infiltration of rainwater into the roadbed increases the amount of extractable heat by an estimated 17% compared to the case of zero infiltration. Using the developed model for scenario analysis, we find that draining rainwater from three single-family houses and storing 30% of the annual heating consumption in the roadbed increases the predicted extractable energy by 56% compared to zero infiltration with no seasonal energy storage. The Climate Road is capable of supplying three new single-family houses with heating, cooling, and rainwater management year-round. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Renewable energy technologies are becoming more attractive and gaining more attention as the world becomes increasingly aware of the negative impacts of global warming and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Two such emerging technologies are geothermal heat pumps (GHP) and solar thermal heating which can be used for heating and cooling of buildings. GHP systems are a well-studied technology that have been proven to be more efficient than traditional air-source heat pumps for space conditioning of buildings. Solar thermal heating has become more common as a way to heat domestic hot water (DHW) in homes, but the two technologies are not often combined. This study presents the findings of combining an open-loop GHP with 100 ft2of flat plate solar thermal panels and a 5,655-gallon sensible water storage tank for space heating and DHW heating needs of a residential home in Bozeman, MT, USA. The goal of this system was to use energy from the solar panels and storage tank first to decrease pumping energy from the GHP well. The open loop system was designed to be a backup system to the solar thermal panels and sensible storage tank. An actual home was modeled to determine potential energy and cost savings of such a system compared to a traditional propane boiler. Then, a case study was performed on the installed system from January to June 2021. Results obtained from April 2nd to June 5th, 2021 indicated that the combination system supplied all necessary heat, and that heat was supplied from the thermal storage tank 55% of the time. This represents a savings of 330 kWh of energy and $36 compared to operating just the open loop geothermal system. From April 2nd to June 5th the combination system consumed a total of 2,510 kWh of energy and cost $274 to operate. Based on data obtained, there is significant potential for energy savings compared to a propane boiler, however only small potential for cost savings. © 2022 AEE East Energy Conference and Expo 2022.

The study analyzes the effectiveness of cooperation of solar thermal and geothermal sources on the example of hospital building with swimming pool in Zakopane (southern part of Poland). In 2015, the solar thermal installation was built in the building with 75 collectors facing south (tilt angle 30 °) and 40 collectors facing west (tilt angle 30 °). Solar collector installation was built as support for the preparation of domestic hot water in the building (sanitary purposes). The rest of the energy is supplied as geothermal energy from the company "Geotermia Podhalańska". Gas boilers are a conventional installation supporting the heating system in "Geotermia Podhalańska". In the solar installation equipped with a heat meter, heat gains were monitored, separately for the south side and separately for the west side. The measured results were compared with the insolation data for Zakopane and the angle and directions of the collectors' surface. The data was obtained from the PVGIS-SARAH website and the government website (Typical Reference Year). The efficiency analysis of the process of obtaining energy was carried out for the period 1 July 2015-31 December 2016 and it amounted to 19% and 11.3% for the south and west sides, respectively. These are very low values for Polish solar thermal installations. Achieving the optimal ecological effect, expressed in the annual reduction of CO2 emissions, depends on the type of the replaced source. For the geothermal Energy with 20% gas boiler option, the CO2 emission reduction value was 1,890 kg. © 2021, Kaprint. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this study, an integrated energy system is deployed to generate electricity, heating, cooling, and domestic hot water for a community considering three fully renewable energy source scenarios: biofuel (Case I), solar-biofuel (Case II), and geothermal energy (Case III). The proposed systems are modeled, assessed, optimized, and compared thermodynamically, economically, and environmentally; in addition, a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer (PEME) is utilized to convert the surplus electricity to stored hydrogen to raise the exergy efficiency and package value-added. Mathematical models are fully developed from thermodynamic and economic perspectives, taking a cumulative inflation rate into account via the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The novelty of the study is to focus on the comparison of the proposed renewable resources as energy inputs for the same condition (community loads), as there is a gap in this regard in the literature. Presented systems are optimized using Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) for minimum net costs as well as maximum exergy efficiency to reach the optimum operating conditions for each case during the peak cooling and heating loads. Moreover, for a more precise comparison of the proposed cases from an exergetic, economic, and environmental point of view, dynamic (hourly) behaviors of systems are analyzed over a year. A comprehensive parametric study is carried out to reckon the influence of borehole drilling depth, geofluid mass flow rate, and soil temperature gradient on case III to appraise its competitiveness in different locations, as well as the effects of the number of collectors on total cost rate and exergy efficiency for case II. Results indicate the annual net costs of $107.1k, $99.5k, and -$505.1k (where the negative sign stands for “income” instead of “cost”) and average exergy efficiencies of 19.1 %, 26.3 %, and 41.3 % for cases I, II and III respectively. © 2023 The Institution of Chemical Engineers},

	abstract = {In this paper, a new geothermal combined cooling, heating and power system that integrates flash power cycle and ammonia-water absorption refrigeration cycle, is proposed to supply electricity, refrigerant water and domestic hot water simultaneously to users. In the system, the refrigeration cycle serves as the bottom cycle of the power cycle by further utilizing the exhausted geothermal water from the flasher of the power cycle, meanwhile all waste heat of the power and refrigeration cycles is recovered for supplying heat, thus effectively improving the energy conversion efficiency of whole system. This paper establishes detailed mathematical models of the proposed system and conducts a valid model validation. Then a preliminary design condition of the system is given and the results show that the exergy efficiency of system could reach 43.69% under the condition of 170 ℃ geothermal water. An exergy loss analysis is carried out based on the design condition, demonstrating that the maximal exergy destruction exists in the condenser of flash cycle, accounting for 48.53% of the total exergy destruction of the system; the components used for separating or mixing fluids including rectification column, absorber and flasher, occupying 17.68%, 9.02% and 9.30% respectively, are prone to generate exergy destructions. Finally a thermodynamic parameter analysis, in order to assess the effects of seven key parameters on the system performance, is performed. The results show that there are an optimal flash pressure (about 300 kPa) and an optimal generator temperature (about 120 ℃) respectively that could make the exergy efficiency of system maximal. Within some scopes, lower turbine back pressure and rectification column pressure, higher ammonia concentration of ammonia-strong solution, bring about higher exergy efficiency of system. Additionally the evaporation pressure and the reflux ratio of rectifier just make little difference on the exergy efficiency of system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

In this study, the energy performance of an energy-sharing community was investigated to improve its energy efficiency and renewable energy self-sufficiency. For a case study, a smart village was selected via detailed simulation. In this study, the thermal energy for cooling, heating, and domestic hot water was produced by ground source heat pumps, which were integrated with thermal energy storage (TES) with solar energy systems. We observed that the ST system integrated with TES showed higher self-sufficiency with grid interaction than the PV and PVT systems. This was due to the heat pump system being connected to thermal energy storage, which was operated as an energy storage system. Consequently, we also found that the ST system had a lower operating energy, CO2 emissions, and operating costs compared with the PV and PVT systems. © 2021 by the authors.

Hybrid ground-source heat pump (HGSHP) combining cooling tower, domestic hot water (DHW), or other auxiliary technologies has been developed to attemper the underground heat or cold accumulation in cooling or heating load-dominated zones. This chapter will discuss several typical hybrid ground-source heat pump systems, how to build and validate the numerical model for the HGSHP system based on the TRNSYS code, and prediction and analysis of the long-term performances of the HGSHP systems considering the ground thermal balance via the optimization of the system operation strategies. This chapter focuses on the research of auxiliary heat dissipation that is suitable for heat accumulation systems. Several schemes for alleviating the underground heat accumulation of GSHP and keeping higher system efficiency are proposed and validated by the simulation work.

	abstract = {A surge of cooling is hitting the building stock, driven by economic growth, population growth in hot areas, urbanisation, climate change and other factors. Even moderate climate zones are experiencing a surge for demand for AC, both in offices and homes. Passive strategies for indoor climate control, sufficient for centuries, simply are not enough anymore. It is a severe challenge to deal with this new cooling demand, while struggling not to lose the race for the mandatory decarbonisation of our society. A promising development is the use of strategies that use balanced heating and cooling with radiative surfaces. Examples of such systems to enhance summer comfort use radiative cooling from hydronic ceilings or floors. In the case study here, the excess heat from the cooling is used to thermally recharge geothermal storage components, e.g. boreholes, reaching seasonal energy efficiency ratios of 10 and above. Based on this charging, and together with the radiative hydronic ceilings or floors, the heating and domestic hot water requirements of a house, as well as of an office or building or community can be met with brine-water-heat pumps at high seasonal COPs of up to 4.5. Several systems like this are already in operation. The feedback from users is predominantly positive. Still, comfort challenges have to be carefully addressed, such as avoiding danger of local discomfort from floor cooling or ceiling heating, avoiding exaggerated expectations towards temperature-controllability, and finally, justifyingthe application of adaptive comfort theory to these buildings, which are not fully free running. © 2020 11th Windsor Conference: Resilient Comfort, WINDSOR 2020 - Proceedings.

	abstract = {Uncovered, liquid-based photovoltaic-thermal (PV-T) collectors can be combined with ground-coupled heat pump systems for different purposes: to increase the evaporator temperature, to regenerate geothermal resources or for pre-heating domestic hot water. This paper experimentally investigates the behavior of a novel PV-T panel with enhanced ambient heat transfer properties and primarily conceived for the operation as the sole heat source for brine-to-water compression heat pumps. After presenting the results of the thermal efficiency measurement of the panel, which attest its unusual parameters (c1= 23 W/m2K c3 = 7.6 J/m3K c6 = 0.1 s/m), we report on the long-term performance tests carried out on large roof-mounted PV-T fields at two different locations in Germany. The investigation focuses on the impact of real environmental and installation conditions on the performance of the field as ambient heat exchanger, operating at fluid temperatures below ambient air temperature. The results confirm the high overall heat transfer coefficient U of the field, up to 40 W/m2K which is reduced by about 20% in comparison to the U-value determined for the single panel, however. The reduction can be attributed to a large extent to the high sensitivity of the collector design to convective heat transfer mechanisms and to the different wind exposure during the tests. For the same reasons we report a 30% decrease in the U-value compared to the basic configuration by using joint plates to cover the gaps of the field with the aim of improving the reliability and aesthetics of the installation. © 2019.

	abstract = {All metropolis across the world are facing the challenges of the growing energy demand and the need to reduce the CO2 emissions. In order to match the two constraints, urban environments should diversify energy sources and maximize local opportunities offered by renewable resources. Within this context, water resources and especially groundwater represent potential alternatives that could provide an efficient answer to the development needs. Nice Côte d'Azur Metropolis gathers around 540,000 inhabitants with more than 350,000 for the city of Nice. Within a national strategic project, the metropolis is currently developing a new urban environment located within the low valley of the Var river and has decided to establish a multi-energy Smart Grid solution. The innovative technological approach is based on: storage of heat, production of cold and electricity, and also a cooling offer for individuals, resulting from the recovery of energy used to air-condition commercial buildings. The chosen solution is based on thermal use of the shallow unconfined aquifer located with the Var floodplain. The network is using surface geothermal energy from the alluvial aquifer. By 2029, it will cover the heating (7.2 GWh per year), air conditioning (15.5 GWh per year) and domestic hot water (7.5 GWh per year) needs of 520,000 m2 of housing, hotels and additional residential facilities, shops, services and offices served by 1.6 km of geothermal network, 5.6 km of hot and cold networks and 94 sub-stations. The Nice Méridia area will thus be supplied by 82% renewable and recovered energy for heating and 78% for cooling. The development of the geothermal solution requests to pump and to reinject important volumes within the unconfined aquifer. In order to assess the potential impact of the solution on the existing uses (drinking water supply pumping stations), a 3D modelling approach has been deployed over the full groundwater resource of the Var valley. The model, built with FEFLOW solution, validated with field observation, can reproduce the behavior of the aquifer (flow dynamic and thermal). The results have demonstrated the efficiency of the 3D modelling approach and the possibility to use the geothermal resource without significant impact on the aquifer. The thermal use of the shallow unconfined aquifer represents a promising solution that could be duplicated in other locations where similar aquifers are present. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a thermodynamic, economic, and environmental analysis of a renewable polygeneration system connected to a district heating and cooling network. The system, fed by geothermal energy, provides thermal energy for heating and cooling, and domestic hot water for a residential district located in the metropolitan city of Naples (South of Italy). The produced electricity is partly used for auxiliaries of the thermal district and partly sold to the power grid. A calibration control strategy was implemented by considering manufacturer data matching the appropriate operating temperature levels in each component. The cooling and thermal demands of the connected users were calculated using suitable building dynamic simulation models. An energy network dedicated to heating and cooling loads was designed and simulated by considering the variable ground temperature throughout the year, as well as the accurate heat transfer coefficients and pressure losses of the network pipes. The results were based on a 1-year dynamic simulation and were analyzed on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis. The performance was evaluated by means of the main economic and environmental aspects. Two parametric analyses were performed by varying geothermal well depth, to consider the uncertainty in the geofluid temperature as a function of the depth, and by varying the time of operation of the district heating and cooling network. Additionally, the economic analysis was performed by considering two different scenarios with and without feed-in tariffs. Based on the assumptions made, the system is economically feasible only if feed-in tariffs are considered: the minimum Simple Pay Back period is 7.00 years, corresponding to a Discounted Pay Back period of 8.84 years, and the maximum Net Present Value is 6.11 M€, corresponding to a Profit Index of 77.9% and a maximum Internal Rate of Return of 13.0%. The system allows avoiding exploitation of 27.2 GWh of primary energy yearly, corresponding to 5.49·103 tons of CO2 avoided emissions. The increase of the time of the operation increases the economic profitability. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

The application of the comprehensive utilization of renewable energy in the construction field has gradually become a need for technical progress and industry development. With the official promulgation and implementation of the Renewable Energy Law in 2006, the application of solar energy, geothermal energy, and other related renewable energy in the construction industry has attracted more and more attention. However, the scope of practical application is currently limited to solar energy alone to supply domestic hot water, power generation, or ground source heat pump system heating and cooling. The actual engineering cases of the combined operation of the two are relatively few, and the unreasonable joint operation mode leads to low system efficiency. In this paper, the combined application system of solar heat utilization and ground source heat pump is elaborated and analyzed in detail, from the technical feasibility, system efficiency, and other aspects of the analysis. It emphasizes the necessity and development prospect of the comprehensive utilization of renewable energy.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Experimental investigations on thermal behavior of a combined solar and ground source heat pump (SGHP) system for a single-family house are presented. The SGHP system was installed at the Lyngby campus of Technical University of Denmark. Detailed experiments were carried out on the system in 2019 under real weather conditions covering domestic hot water (DHW) consumption and space heating (SH) demand. Depending on the contributions of the energy inputs to the combi-storage, five typical daily operation modes are classified. The focus of the investigations is on the dynamic thermal behaviors of the heat storage under different operating conditions. When the combi-storage was primarily heated by solar energy, the inlet stratifier in the storage performed well, ensuring thermal stratification and a good utilization of solar energy. Water temperature in the storage reached up to about 68℃ at the end of the solar heating process. When the combi-storage was primarily heated by the ground heat, the water temperature near the outlet for SH was kept at a temperature range from 26℃ to 31℃ in the heating process to ensure the outlet temperature level of SH, and the water temperature near the outlet for DHW was in the temperature range 47℃∼51℃ in DHW volume. When there was no heat input to the combi-storage, the pre-stored heat can meet the daily heating demand, and the number of days on this mode was up to 9.4% of the total experimental days. The paper gives valuable inputs for researchers and engineers who plan to integrate the combi-storage in a renewable heating system with solar collectors and ground source heat pumps. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {An innovative configuration of an energy system for residential buildings is examined, with the use of a numerical tool that has been developed for simulating renewable energy-based systems based on geothermal and solar energy. The main components are the PV-Thermal (PVT) collectors and a multi-source heat pump supplied by heat from either the ambient air or water, with the option to include a borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) field to increase the system’s overall efficiency. In addition, there are three water tanks for short-term thermal energy storage; a main water tank for domestic hot water (DHW) production, and two buffer tanks, with one connected to the PVT, which supplies the heat pump (solar-assisted mode), and a second one that is charged by the heat pump and from which space heating/cooling is delivered to the building. The developed code in Python solves the non-linear system of equations derived by the mathematical description of these components and their connections for the temporal variations of the temperature in the tanks and the inlet/outlet of each component. The numerical tool is used for detailed investigation of the system performance over time, as well as for analysing various layouts. In the current work, focus is given on the positive effect of the BTES component in the energy system of a building in a warm climate (Athens, Greece) and in a cold one (Copenhagen, Denmark). As expected, PVT collectors contribute heat for DHW production mostly during summer in both locations, whereas during winter they mostly charge the solar buffer tank. Moreover, the improvement of COP for cooling production with BTES is especially prominent during summer in Athens, whereas the effect of the BTES becomes more important during winter in Copenhagen, where the heating demand is high. © ECOS 2021 - 34th International Conference on Efficency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems.},

This article is part of a broader research project aimed at employing artificial intelligence and big data techniques to develop a predictive system for the thermal behavior of the ground in very low-enthalpy geothermal applications. In this initial article, a summarized process is outlined to generate large quantities of synthetic data through a ground simulation method. The proposed theoretical model allows simulation of the soil’s thermal behavior using an electrical equivalent. The electrical circuit derived is loaded into a simulation program along with an input function representing the system’s thermal load pattern. The simulator responds with another function that calculates the values of the ground over time. Some examples of value conversion and the utility of the input function system to encode thermal loads during simulation are demonstrated. It bears the limitation of invalidity in the presence of underground water currents. Model validation is pending, and once defined, a corresponding testing plan will be proposed for its validation. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Human interference with the Earth’s climate cannot be ignored any longer. Renewable energy sources need utmost attention in all energy sectors. For buildings, geothermal energy for heating, cooling, and domestic hot water is a sustainable solution. Horizontal ground heat exchangers (HGHE) demonstrate promising results with low installation costs. Research is focused on increasing their thermal performances by structural improvements and ground thermal proprieties improvements, with little research on using auxiliary heat to increase their performances. A numerical model for an HGHE was established to investigate the effects of auxiliary heat sources on the performances of the HGHE. The results demonstrate that heat transfer into the HGHE increases the overall ground temperature at the end of the heating season by 138.50% compared with no heat transfer from auxiliary heat sources. The ground freezing period decreased by approximately 24.74% by having a heated basement, approximately 40.20% by transferring heat with solar thermal panels, and approximately 62.88% by using both auxiliary heat sources. The difference between the undisturbed ground temperature and the ground temperature with no auxiliary heat sources at the end of the season was 3.45 °C. The difference between the undisturbed ground temperature and the ground temperature with all auxiliary heat sources resulted in 0.92 °C. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {A ground source heat pump (GSHP) delivers heat from a condenser to the ground when it operates with cooling mode. However, the ground temperature increases when the GSHP system operates for a long time. The increased ground temperature can deteriorate the GSHP’s coefficient of performance (COP). To maintain the balance between the ground temperature and COP, the condensation heat from the cooling GSHP can be used for other heating systems before it is transferred to the ground. This study proposes a combined GSHP system connecting a three RT cooling GSHP with a 1.5 RT domestic hot water (DHW) heat pump, and the performance of the system was evaluated through mock-up experiments. In the combined GSHP system, the condensation heat of the cooling system was used as the heat source of the DHW system. Therefore, the ground temperature could be reduced, and the performances of both the GSHP cooler and DHW heater pump could be enhanced. Mock-up experiments for performance evaluation were conducted with cooling-only, DHW-only, and cooling-DHW operational modes. The results showed that cooling-DHW operation slowed down the change in heat source temperature. In comparison with those of the cooling-only and DWH-only heat pumps, the COPs of the cooling heat pump and DHW heat pump of the combined system were increased by 12.93% and 15.47%, respectively. Moreover, the total COP of the cooling-DHW combined GSHP system increased by 4.4% and 29.55% in comparison with those of the cooling-only GSHP and DHW-only GSHP systems, respectively. Practical application: A combined GSHP system was proposed by connecting a GSHP for space cooling with a heat pump for DHW to mitigate the ground temperature changes due to the long-term operation of the GSHP system. The combined system reuses the condensation heat generated by the cooling heat pump as the heat source of the DHW heat pump for ensuring the system performance and building energy saving. Therefore, this system is suitable for buildings with large energy use and heavy hot water demand, especially in summer, such as hospital and hotel buildings. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {The City of Surrey in British Columbia, Canada has recently launched a district energy network (DEN) to supply residential and commercial buildings in the Surrey Centre area with hot water for space and domestic hot water heating. The network runs on natural gas boilers and geothermal exchange. However, the City plans to transition to low-carbon energy sources and envisions the DEN as a key development in reaching its greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reduction targets in the building sector. Harvesting and utilizing waste heat from industrial sites using a mobile thermal energy storage (M-TES) is one of the attractive alternative energy sources that Surrey is considering. In this study, a techno-economic analysis (TEA) was conducted to determine the energy storage density (ESD) of the proposed M-TES technology, costs, and the emission reduction potential of integrating waste heat into Surrey’s DEN. Three transportation methods were considered to determine the most cost-effective and low-carbon option(s) to transfer heat from industrial waste heat locations at various distances (15 km, 30 km, 45 km) to district energy networks, including: (i) a diesel truck; (ii) a renewable natural gas-powered (RNG) truck, and (iii) an electric truck. To evaluate the effectiveness of M-TES, the cost of emission reduction ($/tCO2e avoided) is compared with business as usual (BAU), which is using a natural gas boiler only. Another comparison was made with other low carbon energy sources that the city is considering, such as RNG/biomass boiler, sewer heat recovery, electric boiler, and solar thermal. The minimum system-level ESD required to makes M-TES competitive when compared to other low carbon energy sources was 0.4 MJ/kg. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Solar-ice slurry systems may be a direct alternative to other thermal systems (such as, geothermal heat pumps), but the relation between the boundary conditions and its overall energetic performance is still somewhat unclear. The main purpose of this analysis is to study the energetic performance of two solar-ice slurry systems (one using carbon dioxide as refrigerant for the electrically driven heat pump and the other using propane) under a wide variety of boundary conditions, and to numerically calculate the impact of the main parameters in the overall performance of the system. In this regard, a parametric study has been carried out. The pytrnsys open-source simulation environment, based on TRNSYS, has been used to analyse the Seasonal Performance Factor (SPF) of solar-ice slurry systems in 14 different European locations, two different multifamily residential buildings (a new one and a refurbished one), four collector aperture areas and three ice storage volumes. Collector aperture area and ice storage volume have been sized respect to the total thermal demand of the building: the sum of Domestic Hot Water (DHW) and Space Heating (SH) demands. Numerical results show that the [Formula presented]-based system outperforms the propane-based one for new buildings, while the opposite happens for old ones. Also, it has been proved that an SPF up to 4 is possible in most central Europe climates using solar-ice slurry systems: a mean SPF value of 3.95 has been obtained in Brussels for the propane-based system and 3.70 in Strasbourg for the [Formula presented]-based system. For more extreme climates (like Warsaw or Helsinki), mean SPF values are reduced to 2.50 and 2.70 respectively. Furthermore, a regression model has been developed to calculate the SPF values of solar-ice slurry systems targeting multifamily residential buildings. The obtained expression has a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.215 for the [Formula presented]-based system and 0.201 for the propane-based one. These expressions could be used to make an approximation of the energetic performance of both systems. It has been numerically proved that the most important parameter when it comes to the performance of a solar-ice slurry system is the solar irradiation on the collector area and more specifically, the winter solar irradiation. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {A novel hybrid renewable-energy-based system for generating multiple commodities is investigated in this study. The heat gained from geothermal and solar energy sources is converted into useful products such as electricity, domestic hot water, cooling load, and hydrogen via an integrated energy system including parabolic trough collectors, a Kalina cycle, an ejector refrigeration system, a thermoelectric generator (TEG) unit, an organic Rankine cycle, and a PEM electrolyzer. A comprehensive analysis based on energy, exergy, and exergoeconomic methods is carried out to examine the system from different standpoints. To achieve the finest solution, multi-objective optimization is performed to simultaneously maximize exergy efficiency and minimize the total unit cost of products. The results indicate that, under the optimal condition, the system can attain 35.2% and 37.8 $/GJ, and 1.9 kg/h for exergy efficiency, the total unit cost of products, and hydrogen production rate, respectively. Moreover, by comparing system performance for the base case through a parametric study with and without TEG, it is determined that utilizing this unit could be more beneficial for the total system. However, the result achieved from a case study suggests that it would be economically wise to remove the TEG unit during some cold months. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

A residential building model in Shenyang was built by DeST platform. the cooling and heating load of this building was simulated by the model. The CIGS-BIPV/ T-soil source double heat pump system model was built by TRNSYS platform with building load as the target demand. The system parameters were iteratively calculated and optimized by calling Hooke-Jeeves algorithm in Genopt software. The power generation prediction model of CIGS-BIPV/T module is established by using multiple linear regression method. Results showed that when the Angle of CIGS-BIPV/T module was set from 42° to 45°, and the azimuth Angle was set from south to south by west 1. 56°, the maximum daily power generation could be obtained. The linear regression relationship of the module power generation prediction model was good, and the fitting degree was high, which could accurately predict the system operating parameters.

	abstract = {The use of standard heat pump (HP) systems offers an efficient option to replace conventional heating systems (e.g. oil and gas boilers) for space heating and domestic hot water. Due to the higher noise emissions and the lower overall energy efficiency of air-to-water heat pumps, the use of ground-coupled heat pump systems is increasingly in demand. The cost-efficient dimensioning of horizontal ground heat exchanger (HGHE) systems, considering possible solar waste heat potentials to improve regeneration behaviour, is particularly challenging. The reason for this is the complex system and control engineering optimisation possibilities resulting from the dynamic heat transport behaviour of the horizontal ground heat exchanger. Essential influencing variables such as the water content of the soil due to the groundwater level, rainwater infiltration and surface evaporation can only be described with massive effort using the model equations of the unsaturated zones. However, these variables are necessary to obtain a better fundamental understanding of the usable storage potential of solar-coupled systems and to be able to derive targeted optimisations at the system level. Therefore, the waste heat utilisation potential of PVT collectors for the regeneration of heat pump coupled horizontal ground heat exchanger systems are analysed employing simulations. For this purpose, a PVT-collector model and a HGHE model based on a single-family were developed and validated by experimental investigations. Based on this, a system simulation model consisting of the components PVT-collector, heat pump, heat delivery system, HGHE and the corresponding control units were built using TRNSYS. With the help of the simulation model, parameter studies were carried out, and the main factors influencing the overall energy efficiency (COP) of the system and the seasonal performance factors (SPF) were identified. Furthermore, the solar waste heat utilisation potential of the PVT collectors was analysed to increase the efficiency of the heat pump system. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {This paper presents the development of accurate map-based models for characterizing a new Dual Source Heat Pump prototype. This unit includes three braze plate heat exchangers and a round tube fin heat exchanger, allowing the unit to select different operating modes such as heat pump, chiller, and domestic hot water production using as source the ground or air. Therefore, due to the hybrid typology of this unit and the possibility of reversing the cycle, this work covers the main heat pump and refrigeration equipment technologies currently available on the market (air source and ground source units). The modeling strategy selected has been to provide several polynomial expressions to predict the performance of these units, i.e., compressor energy consumption and condenser and evaporator capacities. This approach allows obtaining accurate, compact, and easy-to-implement models for developing dynamic models of more complex systems where this type of unit – the heat pump – is an integrated part of the system. Currently, a clear example of this modeling strategy can be found in characterizing one of the main components installed in these machines, the compressor. The AHRI-540 standard specifies a polynomial model as a function of evaporating and condensing temperatures. In this sense, for the characterization of heat pumps, the polynomials developed depend only on the unit's external variables, so they can be useful in many scenarios, obtaining direct feedback on the heat pump performance when developing a dynamic model to optimize system control strategies or to develop techno-economic studies. In this case, the hybrid typology of this unit makes it particularly relevant to optimize the control to manage the type of source to be used (air or ground), allowing the development of a more efficient and sustainable technology by selecting the most adequate source in terms of performance. This study focuses on obtaining the polynomial expressions that minimize the number of terms while simultaneously minimizing prediction error. By carefully selecting the most significant terms and suitable transformations in the characterized variables, the goal is to prevent overfitting, minimize potential extrapolation or interpolation errors and obtain polynomial expressions that can be fitted with small experimental samples. For this purpose, a detailed model implemented in a commercial software for heat pump characterization has been used, with which a large number of simulation results were generated. These simulation results include a fine meshing working map of the unit that allowed us to analyze the relationships between the characterized and external variables. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

The main power unit of the system is internal combustion engine (ICE), whose exhaust gas is split between an organic Rankine cycle unit and absorption heat pump (AHP) for energy cascade utilization, and the end flue gas enters the waste heat exchangers to produce domestic hot water. Taking a hotel in Beijing as an example, a simulation model of the system is constructed and an emergy-based exergo-environmental cost method is proposed considering the high temperature equivalent emissions of the whole life-cycle chain from an ecological view. The high temperature exhaust gas allocation ratio is optimized with the optimal specific exergo-environmental cost of system and emergy consumption of each process is evaluated. The results show that the minimize specific exergoenvironmental cost of system is 310 050 seJ/J when 63% of the high temperature exhaust gas from ICE flows to the ORC unit; the ICE and AHP account for 98% of the emergy consumption of the system. © 2023 Harbin Research Institute.

However, a systematic approach for integrating the optimum SAGSHP system in buildings in order to meet the space heating/cooling and the domestic hot water loads is still missing. A novel dynamic targeting approach is proposed. It can predict and guarantee the maximum possible direct and indirect heat recovery in a given building by introducing an interconnected network of heat exchangers (including ground heat exchanger) + energy storage (both electric and thermal energies) + heat pump (HP) + solar photovoltaic (PV) panels based on the real-time hot and cold composite curves (CCs). The main novelty of this approach consists in the fact that the dynamic building's loads and the time variation of renewable and waste sources of energies are included into the targeting procedure. The approach is applied to a multifamily test building, where the solar irradiance and building's heating and cooling demands are taken into account. In addition to the maximum heat recovery, the proposed approach computes the minimum area of the solar photovoltaic panels, the minimum volume of TES, and the minimum capacity of the electric energy storage for each representative day. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

This paper attempted to present/compare four possible solar-assisted ground source heat pumps to supply four purposes of electricity demand, heating/cooling, and domestic hot water. First, the energy needed in the region was designed with DesignBuilder. Then, each proposed system was modeled in Polysun software using a photovoltaic-thermal and a vertical geothermal heat exchanger. Afterward, all probable plans were evaluated and compared technically, economically, and environmentally. The results indicated that the maximum/minimum values of the coefficient of heat pump performance for direct heat exchanger and series systems were 4.39/3.87. Also, the optimal plan was introduced with 4957/10667 kWh electricity consumption/production. Besides, an economic analysis was estimated for the optimal strategy with an investment return of 7years. The designed system prevented 5089kgCO2 emissions annually.

	abstract = {In cold climates, space heating and domestic hot water production account for a large portion of the building’s energy demand and the related CO2 emissions. To sustainably climatize buildings, renewable energy technologies need to be integrated into building energy systems. The ground source heat pump (GSHP) technology is one such clean energy technologies. The energy pile technology is an excellent alternative to conventional borehole heat exchangers which reduces the cost of GSHP systems substantially. This study numerically investigates the long-term performance of a novel energy pile coupled with a GSHP using realistic building loads for a cold climate. A finite volume-based computational model was developed and thoroughly validated using experimental data from a system in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. First, three normalized building load profiles were derived using a building energy model for a typical residential house in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Then a 4-year performance investigation on the performance of the energy pile for the three normalized load profiles was undertaken. In addition, two configurations were considered — one with the pile beneath the basement of the building and another one with the pile at the ground surface level. For the first configuration, results show that the higher heating loads (> 0.4 tons) render the system inoperable for a significant amount of time. Also, the yearly average heating coefficient of performance (COP) decreased over the years while the yearly average cooling COP increased. The average ground temperature decreases for all the load cases, indicating ground thermal imbalance. The decrease in ground temperature was 0.08°C/year, 0.1°C/year, and 0.13°C/year for 0.3, 0.4 and 0.6 tons, respectively. The first configuration yields favorable results compared to the second in terms of system operability and thermal performance due to the reduced influence by low ambient temperatures.

	abstract = {This paper features the integration of two renewable energy sources, making a new trigeneration system for residential applications. The system is primarily powered by solar photovoltaic- thermal (PVT) along with geothermal energy. This trigeneration system consists of a ground source heat pump, solar system, high-grade and low-grade heat exchangers, a heat pump system, and a water storage tank (WST). The objective of this system is to provide the main commodities for residential use including domestic hot water (DHW), electricity, and space heating. The system is analyzed energetically and exergetically using thermodynamic-based concepts. The overall energy and exergy efficiencies of the proposed system are found to be 86.9% and 74.7%, respectively. In addition, the energy and exergy efficiencies of the PVT system are obtained to be 57.91% and 34.19%, respectively. The exergy destructions at the high-grade heat exchanger and the water storage tank add up to 36.9 kW, which makes up 80% of the total exergy destruction of the system. Additionally, parametric studies are conducted to evaluate the degree of impact that various important parameters have on the overall system performance.  Copyright © 2020 by ASME.},

However, the main problem that impedes their use and development is its high cost, especially drilling cost. In this article, we study the energetic and economic impacts of using geothermal water that flows naturally above the surface. Thus, we could benefit from the high energetic and environmental potential of geothermal energy while avoiding the drilling costs. A group of actions dealing with geothermal energy has been worked out on a 150 rooms (300 guests) hotel. Geothermal energy have been used for domestic hot water, sea water tank, interior and exterior pool and rooms heating and some technical loop have been designed to provide cold thermal water. Interesting results have been found. For a geothermal flows used in the project of 9.2 l/s, the induced energy saving would be of 284894 kg LPG. The annual cost saving of the project would be of 131044 TND. The overall annual LPG saving would be of about 71%. Eventually, this study can in part serve as a guideline for similar projects based on geothermal water use. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Sorption thermal energy storage systems have higher energy densities and low long-term thermal losses compared to traditional energy storage technologies, which makes them very attractive for seasonal heat storage application. Although they have a lot of potential at material level, its operation and system implementation for residential application requires further study. The performance of a seasonal sorption thermal energy storage system strongly depends on the discharging process during the cold season. The present study analysed through numerical simulations different scenarios to enhance the thermal performance of a solar-driven seasonal water-based sorption storage, which supplied space heating and domestic hot water to a single-family house in a cold climate region. All studied scenarios were analysed under optimal control policy. The results indicated that the sorption storage could increase by 9 % its energy density if conservative and constant discharging temperature set points are considered, due to fewer interruptions during the discharge. The energy density of the sorption storage driven by solar energy was highly impacted by the weather conditions, and by the type and availability of low-temperature heat source. Indeed, the energy density of the sorption storage increased by 22 % using a water tank to assist the evaporator of the sorption storage, instead of a latent storage tank. The use of a dry-heater to assist the evaporator with environmental heat was not suitable for the climate studied due to the low hours of operation. The sorption storage system composed of 20 modules of LiCl-silica gel could obtain an energy density and a COP of 139 kWh/m3 and 0.39, respectively, if a constant low-temperature heat source (i.e, geothermal or waste energy) was available. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The use of heat pumps for annual climatization is a suitable mean of achieving the 2030 European decarbonization target (-55% with respect to 1990 CO2 emissions). The use of seasonal energy storages allows to store one of the two contemporaneous effects (thermal and cooling energy) produced by the heat pump to be used successively when it is necessary. This paper focuses on a dynamic simulation to size the heating and cooling plant and define a suitable control logic for a refurbished building located in northern Italy. The plant is set up by an electric heat pump in annual operation, coupled with a ground ice storage. Ice produced during heating operation is used in summer to face cooling loads (free cooling). PhotoVoltaic/Thermal modules allow to increase the grid independency and to reduce primary energy consumption of the plant as they can be suitably cooled in any season, by recovering heat for domestic hot water or the ground. A dynamic simulation of the system allows for a full description of the behaviour of the ice tank during the charging and discharging processes. In addition, a primary energy performance analysis of the whole plant is reported, also in comparison to a dual source heat pump configuration for the same building. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Decarbonization of the building sector represents a huge potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. An energy pile-based ground source heat pump system coupled with seasonal solar energy storage was proposed and tailored for high-rise residential buildings to satisfy their heating/cooling demands. An optimal design procedure was developed for the coupled system accounting for the constraints of limiting the temperature changes of the energy pile and avoiding the cold build-up in the ground. The system performance under different ground conditions and heating-dominated climatic conditions across China was evaluated numerically. The results showed that within a typical year of operation the system evolved through three stages, the initial stage of rapid heat injection into the ground, the following developed stage with slower or no heat injection, and the final stage of heat extraction for space heating. The system could well meet the heating demands of buildings in the cold zone with the solar collector efficiency ranging from about 40% to 58%. For cases in the severely cold zone, favourable ground conditions were critical for the system to cover the heating demands. In addition, integrating domestic hot water preheating into the system could improve its performance, especially for cases in unfavourable ground conditions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Heat pumps use the heating network as a source and can supply the consumers with space heating and domestic hot water as needed. Although individual manufacturers provide performance figures for the source temperature of 20 °C, these are usually derived from extrapolation from standard conditions with source temperatures of 0 °C and 10 °C. Up to now practical measurements are missing how efficiently heat pumps work in an ULTDH network environment and how the network temperature spread affects the performance. In this paper test rigs are used to investigate heat pumps under the conditions in ULTDH networks at a network supply temperature of 20 °C. It is shown that heat pumps can operate up to twice as efficient as with a geothermal probe. Furthermore, the network temperature spread has a significant influence on the performance of the heat pump. Heat pumps operate significantly better with a low source temperature spread. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The use of multi-source energy systems is a promising technical solution for the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions and, at the meantime, for enhancing the exploitation of renewable energy sources. The present paper analyses a Solar Assisted Ground Source Heat Pump system and tries to fill the gap in the literature, where a direct comparison between the consolidated solar thermal technology and the emerging and widely discussed photovoltaic thermal technology is missing. Indeed, the two different devices for the exploitation of solar energy have been analysed through dynamic simulations carried out in TRNSYS environment. Through this approach, it is possible to investigate and predict in detail the thermal and electrical behaviour of the energy system, composed by a water-to-water heat pump, which withdraws from two thermal reservoirs that are connected to a solar loop, composed either of solar thermal collectors or of photovoltaic thermal panels and to a ground loop. The heat pump is used to provide space cooling and space heating to a residential building, through fan coil terminal units or radiant floor system. Furthermore, the heat pump system assists the solar field in the production of domestic hot water. This study looks at the development of a flexible system able to work in different operating conditions. The model's boundary conditions can be changed for simulating a variety of case studies as the weather condition, the building load and the domestic hot water profile can be easily changed, together with specific components’ parameters. The control strategy makes it possible to vary the setpoint temperatures for simulating different operating conditions and management choices. In this way, the user can easily adapt the model functions to a specific plant system. The operating conditions of the two systems layouts have been compared and the energy performances evaluated for three case studies characterised by the weather conditions of the European cities of Berlin (mild-cold climate), Venice (mild climate) and Barcelona (mild-warm climate), and the corresponding thermal load profile of a two-storey building with a useful floor area of 170 m2. The study shows the possibility to directly exploit the solar energy for the domestic hot water production and as a heat source for the heat pump. The results from the comparison between the two systems’ configurations, with photovoltaic thermal panels and with solar thermal collectors, prove that there is the possibility to obtain a relevant improvement in the efficiency of the heat pump using photovoltaic thermal panels. The investigated multi-source energy system, moreover, allows an optimal employment of the available renewable heat sources and could easily be applied to case studies characterized by different boundary conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Ground source heat pump systems are gradually accepted and used for space heating in winter and air-conditioning in summer for rural households in North China. To keep geothermal equilibrium, a split type ground source heat pump system combining with solar photovoltaic-thermal (STGSHP-PV/T) simulation model is established. The operating performance of the STGSHP-PV/T system has been investigated. Results show that the coefficient of performance (COP) of heat pump units during the heating and cooling period is 3.53 and 2.81, respectively. Except providing spacing heating and cooling for separated rural households, the system offers other accessibility options including power generation and domestic hot water supply. During the operation of STGSHP-PV/T system, the PV panel temperature maintains at a relatively lower operating temperature and higher PV efficiency. The comprehensive performance coefficient of PV/T component is about 66%, and the power generated by PV/T module is greater than that consumed by heat pump units by approximately 1278.1 kWh, which can achieve zero-energy buildings during the whole year. Moreover, the average soil temperature increases gradually under the long term operation of the STGSHP-PV/T system, and the increase rate is 0.12 to 0.26 °C per year, within an acceptable range. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Solar energy plays a crucial role in the transition currently underway towards fully renewable energy systems. Solar energy can be converted into several secondary energy vectors such as electricity, cooling energy, thermal energy. In recent years, solar electric technologies have undergone tremendous development, causing a dramatic decrease of their capital cost. On the other hand, a big effort is still necessary to achieve similar results for solar thermal systems. Such devices convert solar radiation into thermal energy by means of a heat transfer fluid (air, water, or others). In general, they are adopted for various purposes: production of domestic hot water, space heating or cooling, drying/heating of agricultural products, thermal desalination, etc. However, their efficiency and their economic profitability must be further improved in order to achieve a massive commercialization. In this framework, the integration of solar systems with different technologies is extremely promising and attractive. In particular, solar thermal collectors can be easily integrated with thermal energy storages (sensible and latent heat storage), absorption and compression heat pumps (solar assisted heat pumps), water desalination plants, and thermal power plants. The integration of solar thermal systems with conventional non‐renewable technologies and with other renewable energy sources (geothermal, biomass, wind, etc.) represents a further interesting solution to improve the exploitation of renewable energy sources. Such integrated systems are expected to mitigate the typical fluctuations of solar systems, dramatically improving their economic profitability. Such integrated systems can also provide important benefits for the transition towards zero or nearly zero energy buildings, especially in case of building‐integrated solar technologies (BIST). In this context, the Special Issue “Integrated Solar Thermal Systems” is focused on the most recent advances in the integration of solar thermal systems with other technologies, and it aims to address the newest and most promising developments of such systems. In this editorial, the collected papers analyzing such topics are summarized. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Ground-Coupled Heat Pumps (GCHPs) are known as a promising technology for building climatization and domestic hot water production. The main concern to employ these systems in urban areas is their high drilling and initial cost. This cost could be rebated by lowering the borehole thermal resistance and by shortening the borehole depth. In the present paper, a novel and simple design of the Ground Heat Exchanger (GHE), namely the vertical GHE with an elliptical U-tube, is proposed to improve thermal performance of GCHP systems. To prove that; a series of 3D finite element simulations are performed to study the thermal comportment of elliptical U-tubes and to compare their performance with typical single U-tubes. A dimensionless shape factor γ is introduced to evaluate effect of the elliptical U-tube geometry on thermal performance of the GHE. Furthermore, influential parameters on thermal performance of elliptical U-tubes are investigated and the decrement percentage of the borehole thermal resistance, with reference to the typical U-tube, are compared for each parameter. The results show that elliptical U-tubes could enhance heat transfer to significant extent and could decrease the borehole thermal resistance by more than 17 %, compared with typical single U-tubes. It is shown that the higher value of the shape factor γ leads to the better heat transfer enhancement. It is concluded that elliptical U-tubes are able to decrease the borehole thermal resistance and to boost the coefficient of performance (COP) of GCHP systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

In this research, analysis and optimization of a combined cooling, heating, desalination and power (CCHDP) system is performed based on solar energy and the geothermal source in four seasons with the aim of addressing the NZEB from energy, exergy and exergoeconomic perspectives. The CCHDP system is equipped with a geothermal well and photovoltaic/thermal panels (PVT) as supplier sources. Moreover, cooling (absorption chiller) and heating (stratified storage tank 1) units, domestic hot water supply unit (heat exchanger), potable water production unit (multi-effect desalination) and power production units (organic ranking cycle 1 (ORC 1), organic ranking cycle 2 (ORC 2)) are as consumers. Combination of steady-state and dynamic methods carried out by Engineering Equation Solver (EES) and TRNSYS packages for calculate the cooling, heating and electrical demands of the building and the system for four seasons. In addition, considering the net output power, total cost rate and exergy efficiency of the system as objective functions, the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is used for optimization. Results showed maximum exergy efficiency and minimum total cost rate of the system were 81.2 % and 21.15 $/h in spring, respectively. Also, the minimum amount of state of charge was 0.15 in summer, which exhibits appropriate use of battery capacity. Electrical analysis has highlighted that the maximum power sold to the grid is related to spring and the present system never needs the grid power. Optimization is carried out to improve the performance of the proposed system.

	abstract = {Hybrid heat production systems, in which sustainable technologies such as Combined Heat and Power (CHP) or heat pumps are combined with auxiliary heaters, have the potential to increase energy efficiency in buildings. In order to exploit this potential, a proper hydronic configuration of the production system is of uttermost importance. Unfortunately, both scientific literature and design guides have focussed little on this aspect. Therefore, this paper proposes a general simulation-based design methodology for selecting the hydronic configuration of a hybrid production system. To illustrate the methodology, it is applied on different case studies in which either a CHP or an Electrical ground-coupled Heat Pump (EHP) is assisted by an auxiliary boiler. The considered apartment building is equipped with a collective heating system for both space heating and domestic hot water (DHW) production, and four different combinations of the temperature levels are considered. Results show that if a CHP is considered, the auxiliary boiler should be implemented in parallel and be assisted by a modulating valve: this increases the Relative Primary Energy Savings (RPES) with up to 6.2 percentage points. EHPs require a separate circuit in the production system for space heating and DHW, preferably with preheating of the domestic cold water (an increase in RPES of up to 16.1 percentage points was reported). The use of a new type of Load Duration Curve to analyse the simulation results proved to be a comprehensible measure for decision making at the level of every stakeholder in the design process. In conclusion, the proposed methodology can assist these stakeholders in their pursuit of high performance hybrid heat production systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

In fact, thermal energy production represents up to 50 % of building's total energy consumption and 75 % of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions. Different systems and storage methods can be integrated to reduce the cost and the GHG emissions related to heating, cooling and Domestic Hot Water (DHW) production in buildings. In this context, multiple studies have developed optimal control systems (such as Model Predictive Control) for optimising thermal production and/or storage systems. The results presented in these studies showed a wide range of reduction rates due to different hypotheses, models, methods and systems taken into consideration. In real time optimisation, the building model is usually separated from the thermal system. In this study, a reduced model and a continuous optimisation method were used to minimise the cost of the building's heating. The applied strategy combined the building model and thermal mass with a Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP) and a Borehole Thermal Energy Storage (BTES). This first approach showed promising results by reducing the cost between 10 % and 15 %. This method will be used to combine different systems and improve their performance in real-time. © International Building Performance Simulation Association, 2022},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a newly developed integrated multigeneration energy system designed for a smart community. The system constitutes of various renewable energy sources, including solar and wind farms, and a quintuple geothermal system with reinjection. The system meets the demand and provides the main commodities of a small city with 5000 houses for their electricity, space heating, domestic hot water, and fresh water. The system is analyzed both energetically and exergetically using thermodynamic principles. The overall energy and exergy efficiencies of the proposed system are found to be 81.3% and 84.6% respectively. In addition, the energy and exergy efficiencies of the PVT system are 57.9% and 49.2%, respectively. The total electricity production is evaluated at 430 MW, while the capacity for domestic hot water is 20 MW. District heating is incorporated into this system at a capacity of 50 MW. The energy and exergy efficiencies of the geothermal system are found to be 27.6% and 35.7% respectively. Within the organic Rankine cycle, the exergy destruction at the boiler and the condenser add up to 15.8 MW, which makes up 94% of the total exergy destruction of this cycle. Moreover, a number of parametric studies are conducted to evaluate the level of influence that key parameters have on each system and consequently the overall system performance. © 2020},

	abstract = {Experimental and theoretical investigations have been carried out on the first large scale solar assisted ground source heat pump (SAGSHP) for heating and cooling of a village in the outskirts of Beijing. Long term performances of the system without and with solar heating were monitored. A TRNSYS model of the SAGSHP system was developed and validated against the measured data. Based on a parametrical investigation using the model, an optimized solution was proposed. It is shown that adding a domestic hot water system to the original SAGSHP system will not only help to secure thermal balance of the ground but also reduces primary energy consumption for hot water by 70%. The system COP increases by 9.4% from 2.42 to 2.65 and the annual overall operating cost decreases from 892,000 CNY to 794,000 CNY with only a small increase in equipment cost. Under the premise of ensuring thermal balance of the ground, there is an optimal match between the size of the ground heat storage, the collector area and the tank volume.

	abstract = {Swimming halls (SHs), which belong to special building sector, are easily overlooked as significant energy users and carbon producers. The demands of heat (e.g., pool water heating, domestic hot water, space and supply air heating) and electricity (e.g., Saunas, pool pumping and ventilation) in SHs are both very high, which indicates the high energy saving potentials. This paper comprehensively introduced and summarized the energy-saving potentials mainly for the heating system in SHs. After briefly introducing the global energy and building energy backgrounds, the energy system of SHs was firstly introduced, including its energy use and breakdown, ventilation demand, and heat losses. Then, renewable and sustainable energy sources applied in SHs were reviewed, especially solar energy application in terms of individual solar-assisted heating and hybrid solar-assisted heat pump systems, while geothermal and biomass and other energy applications were also introduced briefly. Furthermore, building energy management (BEM) strategies were introduced and summarized comprehensively, including waste heat utilization, prediction of energy demand and consumption, control and optimization of HVAC system, and demand response potentials of both electricity and district heat. In the discussion part, the recommendations of high-efficient or energy-saving technologies in SHs were given as well as the future development. Finally, suggestions were given for achieving energy efficiency and carbon reduction in SHs via using renewable energy sources (especially solar energy), optimizing the energy and HVAC systems, possible waste heat recoveries, and applying demand response of energy. In addition, establishing feasible and comprehensive energy indexes to evaluate energy use in SHs is also essential in the future. © 2021},

	abstract = {In recent years, one of the key postulates in the European Union’s policy has become the development of renewable energy sources. In order to achieve the desired synergy effect, the idea of combining two selected sources of energy appeared. This article presents a technical and economic analysis of a hybrid connection of a ground source heat pump with a photovoltaic installation. Taking into account the heat demand of the building, a ground heat pump with a catalog nominal heating power of 25 kW was selected. This article presents the problem of the economic profitability of using a hybrid combination of a heat pump and photovoltaic panels in domestic hot water and central heating systems. The justification for the use of such heat sources in these installations is due to global trends and the gradual departure from conventional energy sources such as oil or gas boilers. This paper presents the economic and ecological results of using the pump heat connected together with photovoltaic panels. In the economic analysis, with the assumed installation costs related to the use of the considered heat pump and PV, two parameters commonly used in the investment analysis (static and dynamic) were used, namely, the simple payback period and the net present value of the investment. For the adopted assumptions, the usable area of the facility and the number of years of use were indicated, at which the investment in question is competitive with other alternative investment interest methods and will start to bring tangible benefits. The performed analysis also has measurable environmental benefits in the form of a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions at the level of 2893 kg/year into the atmosphere. The presented solution will help future investors understand the investment profitability mechanism for their households. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Numerous cost-optimal studies have been undertaken by EU member states to define minimum energy performance requirements for buildings within that member state in accordance with the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. As few of these studies have examined the effect of heating and ventilation system parameters on life cycle cost (LCC) and energy use in detail, this paper analysed 84 HVAC solution-sets, including parameters for the heating supply system, heating distribution system and ventilation system, for a case study in Norway. The choice of heating supply system was the dominant parameter, with ground source heat pump solutions offering the lowest purchased energy use and LCC. Electric water heating and district heating systems had low capital costs which make these options more attractive to property developers looking for a good return on investment. Using an exhaust ventilation system with an exhaust air heat pump lowered LCC and capital costs for ground source heat pump and district heating systems but does not meet current Norwegian energy regulations. Despite using more energy, a constant setpoint schedule resulted in a lower LCC than a variable setpoint system due to the variation in hourly energy pricing and the dominant role of monthly pricing based on peak load. The choice of yearly heating strategy and heat emitter had a relatively small impact on energy use, capital cost and LCC. With all the parameters combined, there was variation within each heating system of up to 21 kWh/(m2∙year) in energy use, 78 Euro/m2 in capital cost and 236 Euro/m2 in LCC. Therefore, it is important that such system parameters are considered in cost-optimal assessments to give a fair comparison of HVAC systems. © 2023 The Author(s)},

The aim of this work was to analyse potential savings that can be achieved by installing solar thermal energy for production of domestic hot water in the hospitals of Extremadura (Spain). For this purpose, 25 hospitals between 533 and 87,118 m2 and between 15 and 529 beds were studied, three solar factor scenarios were simulated (0.70, 0.75 and 0.80) and the necessary investment and corresponding economic and environmental savings were calculated. Better economic results and energy ratios for 70% of solar contribution were obtained. These results show an average payback of 4.74 years (SD = 0.26) reaching 4.29 kWh/€ per year (SD = 0.20). Undertaking an investment of 674,423 €, 2,895,416 kWh/year of thermal energy could be generated with which to save both 145,933 € and 638 tons of CO2 per year. It was statistically demonstrated the priority of carrying out an installation with a solar factor of 70%, investing preferably in hospitals in Cáceres over those in Badajoz, especially in the public sector with more than 300 beds. These findings will provide hospital managers with useful information to make decisions on future investments. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Domestic hot water (DHW) heating is one of the most energy-consuming activities in a typical household. Photovoltaics (PV) connected with a ground source heat pump (GSHP) offers a low-emission method for DHW heating. This paper studies four different control methods for DHW heating in a building with a GSHP and a PV system. The main control method aims to minimize DHW heating costs by utilizing Nord Pool Spot market information together with a PV production output forecast. The results of this control method, implemented with a perfect PV output forecast and assessed over three years of hourly data, indicate that annual cost savings over other methods are achievable. Results with the real-world actual PV output forecast, evaluated between June–September 2020, demonstrate DHW heating cost savings up to 36–53%, even though forecasting errors are present. The heating costs are 9–11% higher compared against the perfect forecast case. The suggested control method thereby effectively reduces the costs when compared with all other methods, and its performance is not significantly affected even when an actual imperfect forecast is implemented.

	abstract = {This paper introduces a flexibility concept in development of a novel multigeneration energy system driven by a renewable energy heat source. Nevertheless, the energy system can be upgraded to a highly productive system by incorporating other subsystems for achieving more production such as domestic hot water and freshwater. A novel design is proposed for a system comprising organic Rankine cycle, absorption compression heat pump, liquid natural gas to natural gas converting system, domestic water heater, and humidifier-dehumidifier desalination to exploit the Sabalan geothermal source for multigeneration purposes. Due to its high-efficient and environmentally friendly characteristics, n-pentane is utilized in the organic Rankine cycle. Also, the Ammonia-water is employed in the absorption compression heat pump subsystem. Energy, exergy, and thermoeconomic analysis is conducted on the plant along with multi-objective optimization based on the parametric study of key variants. According to the results, the novel step-by-step flexibility analysis can give a wide viewpoint to the designers to make the best multiple plant. The results of multi-objective optimization indicate that the freshwater production increases from 0.803 kg/s to 0.834 kg/s, the capacity of the domestic water heater rises from 1254 kW to 1265 kW, and the net output power surges up by 137.96 kW. However, the heating production falls from 1276 to 1088 kW. Furthermore, the total energy and exergy efficiencies increase by 6.43% and 4.47% with a 2.08 $/GJ reduction in the unit cost of the product. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The procedure includes the calculation of all the required geothermal parameters in both assumptions. Optimization of the drilling schema is carried out using COMSOL Multiphysics software. Technical and economic results reveal that scenario 1 is the most suitable option for the study case here presented.

The building sector is one of the most energy-intensive sectors that play an important role in energy consumption and pollutants emission. This study aims to present an alternative plan to reduce fossil energy consumption in residential buildings. Considering the high potential of renewable energy sources, especially ground source heat pumps (GSHP) combined with solar energy near to residential sector can lead to a shift to zero energy building. Here, an attempt is made to provide the building energy requirement including the domestic hot water, heating, cooling, as well as electricity generation for sale to the national network, by presenting and comparing three scenarios assessment; the first scenario is the reference building, the second one equipped building with the GSHP system, and the third scenario includes the combination of GSHP and building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) along with the solar collector. The dynamic simulation is performed using TRNSYS software. By comparing the proposed scenarios, the results confirmed that a decrease in energy consumption is observed in the second and third scenarios by 2 and 26 percent, respectively compared to the First scenario. Economically assessment revealed that the initial net present value (NPV) in the third scenario is 18.8% and 14.1% higher than the NPV of the first and second scenarios, respectively. The return on investment (ROI) calculation shows that the investment return after 7 years for the second scenario, while this is 8 years for the first and the third scenarios. Moreover, from the environmental point of view, the second and third scenarios have led to a reduction of 11% and 41% in carbon dioxide emissions, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

For this aim, the main components of a DHS and the primary RES with applications in DHSs were described briefly. Finally, several case studies regarding the DHS in Timisoara, Romania, were analysed. Thus, by integrating water source HP (WSHP) systems in cooperation with solar thermal and photovoltaic (PV) collectors and reducing the supply temperature from 110 °C to 30 °C in DHS, which supplies the water radiators to consumers in a district of this city in a 58/40 °C regime of temperatures and produces domestic hot water (DHW) required by consumers at 52 °C, a thermal energy saving of 75%, a reduction in heat losses on the transmission network of 90% and a diminution of CO2 emissions of 77% were obtained. Installed PV panels generate 1160 MWh/year of electricity that is utilised to balance the electricity consumption of HP systems. Additionally, mounting pumps as turbines (PATs) for the recovery of excess hydraulic energy in the entire heating network resulted in electricity production of 378 MW, and the variable frequency drive’s (VFD) method for speed control for a heating station pump resulted in roughly 38% more energy savings than the throttle control valve technique. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {More than 30% of the world's energy consumption depends on building sector which causes 27% of total greenhouse gas emissions. More than 50% of this load is associated to space heating and cooling in buildings. The ground source heat pumps are used in building sector especially in harsh and warm climates, as a valid alternative to electric air-to-air/water heat pumps traditionally used to supply heating, cooling and domestic hot water loads. This study proposes an analysis on experimental basis of a ground source heat pump with a combi-thermal storage by means of real components and a Hardware in Loop test bed installed in a laboratory in Germany. The study will be conducted by using Second Law analysis of Hardware in Loop system allow to investigate different operating conditions and to identify the devices of the thermal plant that exhibit the largest exergy losses, efficiency defect and the greatest room for improvement. By considering an emulated constant thermal load equal to 5 kW for building during heating period, the ground source heat pump results the highest dissipative component of whole plant by destroying about 36% of exergy input in experimental test conditions which are a ground temperature of 6 °C, evaporator inlet temperature of about 0 °C and condenser water supply temperature of 46.8 °C. In this condition the heat storage exhibits an efficiency defect of 19.1% demonstrating that it is a strategic component for plant. A sensitivity analysis has been defined by varying on experimental basis the brine input to evaporator and water supply temperatures. The variation in the first parameter corresponds to a range on ground temperature from 5 to 25 °C while the second one allows to evaluate a range of supply temperature to storage of 35 ÷ 60 °C. In addition, an exergoeconomic analysis has been conducted in order to evaluate the unit exergoeconomic product cost by showing that the exergoeconomic unit price of product for end-users depends on balancing of both electricity cost and investment cost that highly depend on ground and heat pump supply temperature condition. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Towards the development of highly integrated and energy efficient heating and cooling systems, with an energy community perspective, the present paper proposes a novel technical solution for the provision of air-conditioning, domestic hot water and electricity to a small residential district in heating-dominant regions. Three reference climates have been considered: Helsinki, Berlin and Strasbourg. Detailed dynamic models have been created using TRNSYS and NeMo, and long term operations of the energy system, including a new-generation ultra-low temperature district heating and cooling network have been performed. The core of the energy system is the network supplied by a high-efficiency ground source heat pump and used as the source and sink by booster heat pumps installed in the substations. Rooftop photovoltaic thermal panels partially meet the electrical demand of the district, as well as the thermal load for domestic hot water production. Moreover, the panels are cooled by the network, obtaining a reduction in the thermal unbalance to the ground and enhancing their electrical efficiency. This solution allows obtaining high coefficient of performance for the heat pumps in the substations and supply stations, reaching values of 5.4 and 4.0, respectively, for heating provision in the coldest locality. The proposed multi-energy district reaches an electrical self-consumption of 71% in the coldest locality and efficiently combines different renewable energy sources at district level in cold climates. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Various efforts have been made worldwide to reduce energy use for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems and lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Research and development are essential to ensuring the efficient use of renewable energy systems. This study proposes a multiple sources and multiple uses heat pump (MMHP) system that can efficiently respond to heating, cooling, and domestic hot water (DHW) loads using multiple natural heat sources. The MMHP system uses ground and air heat as its primary heat sources and solar heat for heat storage operations and ground temperature recovery. For the efficient use of each heat source, it also determines the heat source required for operation by comparing the heat source temperatures in the same time zone. A model for predicting the heat source temperatures, electricity use, and coefficient of performance (COP) was constructed through simulation. To analyze the efficiency of the proposed system by comparing the existing air source heat pump with ground source heat pump systems, a performance analysis was conducted by setting regional and system configurations as case conditions. The results demonstrate that the electricity use of the MMHP system was 13–19% and 1–3% lower than those of air source heat pump (ASHP) and ground source (GSHP) systems, respectively. In addition, the MMHP system was the most favorable in regions with a low heating load. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The proposed cycles were simulated by EES software and validated by reliable references. The investigations demonstrate that considering thermodynamics’ first and second law, cycle C has the best performance compared to cycles A and B with acceptable functionality on an exergoeconomic standpoint. For cycle C, energy efficiency, exergy efficiency, and net output power were calculated as 69.75 %, 29.79 %, and 68.8 kW, respectively. The exergoeconomic analysis of cycle C revealed the cost of product and exergy destruction as 160.4$/GJ and 150.45 kW, respectively. An exergoenvironmental study was compiled to study the effects of the system on the environment with respect to associated environmental parameters.

Based on the theoretical potential of hydrothermal heat in place, the technical and economic potential is determined with a review and an analysis of existing geothermal plants. To this end, the thermodynamic and economic performance of operating power plants is analyzed and models for the efficiency and the production costs are developed. Based on this analysis, a technical potential of 12.2PWh el and 16.7PWh th as well as an economic potential of 9.1PWhel and 12.5PWhth is determined. In order to derive an annual contribution from the economic potential, the regeneration of the resource is taken into account. Considering a sustainable exploitation rate, an annual economic potential of 9.1TWhel/a and 12.5TWhth/a is derived. This corresponds to a share of 1.51% of the gross electricity demand and a share of 1.48% of the demand for space heating and domestic hot water.

In the case of spa resorts, the use of heat from hot springs for therapeutic baths is an option. It is necessary to cool down this thermal mineral water to a temperature acceptable to the human body. However, due to the high mineral content of this water, heavy fouling can be a problem for conventional heat exchangers. The purpose of this study is to identify the suitable cooling technology in terms of required cooling capacity and waste heat recovery capability. The cooling technology was selected on the basis of a literature search. A pilot cooling unit consisting of vacuum cooler and plate heat exchanger was designed and tested in a real spa resort for six months. Both selected technologies have demonstrated the ability to cool thermal mineral water in long-term operation, as well as the possibility to utilize waste heat for domestic hot water heating. However, fouling problems occur in the plate heat exchanger. The vacuum cooler demonstrated greater operational robustness and resistance to encrustation. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Compost Heat Recovery Systems (CHRS) represent an innovative technology to provide domestic decentralized thermal energy, recovering the heat naturally produced during the aerobic biodegradation of waste biomass, coming from gardening/farm-ing/forestry activities. CHRSs represent an alternative to centralized grid-connected power systems and are usually installed (combined with most traditional systems) to power underfloor heating systems (UHS) or domestic hot water systems (DHWS), lowering impacts and costs of thermal energy production. In this study, the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of CHRSs (measured as kgCO2-eq/kWh) was investigated using life cycle assessment (LCA) approach, considering the whole life cycle of an average plant. CHRSs showed a negative Net value of GWP impact, equal to-0.268 kgCO2-eq/kWh, as full balance of positive (0.062 kgCO2-eq/kWh) and negative (-0.329 kgCO2-eq/kWh) emissions. Negative emissions are related to avoided primary mate-rials, replacement of natural gas used as traditional thermal energy production and replacement of mineral fertilizers. Considering only the positive emissions (0.062 kgCO2-eq/kWh), CHRSs emerged to be in line with Solar Hot-Water Systems (0.061 kgCO2-eq/kWh mean value) and slightly higher than Geothermal Systems (0.019 kg-/kWh mean value). Along with GWP impact, other midpoint and endpoint impact indicators were assessed and all showed a negative Net value: Particulate CO2-eq Matter PM (-2.36E-5 kgPM2.5-eq/kWh), Fresh Water eutrophication FWE (-6.78E-06 kgP-eq/kWh), Fresh Water ecotoxicity FWec (-2.10E-01 CTUe/kWh), Human Toxicity cancer effect HTc (-5.68E-09 CTUh/kWh), Human Toxicity non-cancer effect HTnc (-3.51E-09 CTUh/kWh) and Human Health HH (-5.22E-08 DALY/kWh).

	abstract = {Today, and into the future, technology will need to minimize environmental impacts while providing adequate energy with cost savings. Oil well conversion for geothermal direct use may meet these needs for rural communities. The Williston Basin has the necessary geological setting and production infrastructure, though often lacking localized techno-economic analysis of system potentials. This project provides such analysis. With an emphasis on alleviating energy poverty, providing jobs for the energy transition, and increasing local availability of nutritious food stock, a case study for Mandaree, North Dakota is made. Mandaree is a town in the West Segment of the MHA Nation on Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. There are more than 70 oil and gas wellheads within 3.5km of the town center, most exploiting Bakken shales at a depth greater than 3000m. At shallower depths are several hot sedimentary aquifers, with temperatures higher than required for modern district heating (<70C). Initial community survey indicates a desire for commercial greenhouses, both for jobs and nutritious food stocks. To meet these needs, as well as the domestic hot water and space heating demands of Mandaree, the focus is further narrowed to the Inyan Kara formation. The Inyan Kara formation is approximately 1550m below the surface with all abandoned wells penetrating the layer on their way to deeper drilling targets. From previous injection well and wastewater disposal studies, the formation has a high permeability and a thermostratigraphy derived temperature of greater than 80°. Analytical methods for open hole flow rates indicate potentials between 91-244 L/s of fluid production per well. This project isolates two abandoned, but not plugged, gas wells for a production-injection doublet configuration about 1400m from the town center. It explores the economic potential, technical considerations, and future work necessary to achieve some of the energetically enabled desires of the community. Copyright © 2021 Geothermal Rising.},

A case study corresponding to a French residential building is used to assess the feasibility of achieving this target. Starting from an actual construction built in 2016, various improvement measures are studied: lowering heating energy needs, implementing bio-sourced materials and renewable energy systems (geothermal heat pump, solar domestic hot water production, and photovoltaic electricity production). Dynamic thermal simulation is used to evaluate energy consumption and overheating risk in hot periods. Greenhouse gas emissions are quantified using a consequential life cycle assessment approach, considering that during a transition period, exporting electricity avoids impacts corresponding to marginal production on the grid. Avoided impacts decrease and become zero when the grid is ultimately “decarbonized”. From this point, the building should be net zero emissions, but there remain unavoidable emissions. Residual GhG (greenhouse gas) emissions account for 5.6 kgCO2 eq/m2 annually. The possibility of offsetting these emissions is investigated, considering sequestration in forests or vegetation systems. A net zero emission level can be achieved, but on a national level, it would require that the whole sequestration potential of forest growth be devoted to offset emissions of new construction.

This follows from a previous publication that detailed the empirical measurements and design of a heating system designed on the basis of a 15-month monitoring period of the water flow and temperature. The perennial water flow at a relatively high temperature enabled the system to operate more efficiently than a typical heat pump system with boreholes or trenches. The performance of the water source heat pump has been monitored for a 4-month period, and the coefficient of performance as well as the energy saving is reported in the present study. The findings of this study not only indicate the energy, carbon dioxide and financial benefits of the heating system, but also highlight key issues during the operation in such a demanding underground environment. Further renewable heat potentials for the rest of the subway network and opportunities to commercialise the excess heat energy output are explored. © 2017 ICE Publishing. All rights reserved.},

GSHPs, therefore, have the potential to reduce heating, cooling, and domestic hot water costs, however the high installation cost of borehole heat exchangers (BHEs) limits the growth of such installations. Nevertheless, GSHPs can be profitable under certain conditions (climate, expensive fuels, subsidies, etc.), which can be identified using geo-referenced data and Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The proposed work investigates the economic and financial ability of GSHPs to cover the heat demand of the residential building stock of the Italian region Valle d’Aosta. To identify the opportunities offered by GSHPs in the Valle d’Aosta region, more than 40,000 residential buildings were analyzed using a GIS-based method. The return on the investment was then assessed based on the occurrence of two conditions—the Italian subsidies of the “Conto Termico” and the installation of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems—which contribute to the reduction of the initial and operation costs, respectively. The life-cycle costs of the four resulting combinations were compared with conventional systems composed of an oil/gas boiler and an air-source chiller. One of the main findings of this study is that subsidies exert a key role in the financial feasibility of GSHPs, especially for replacing gas boilers, whereas the presence of a PV system has a minor influence on the financial analysis carried out. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Due to its remoteness, extreme weather conditions, limited local energy availability, low population, and limited energy-transportation infrastructure, the region of Nunavik, located in the northernmost part of Québec (Canada), is fully dependent on imported refined petroleum products. They rely mainly on fuel oil for their heating needs, leading to high energy costs and sustainability issues. Recently, several studies were carried out to improve the energy independence and security of remote regions of Canada using renewable energies. However, on several occasions, energy sources and technologies were evaluated under different models and methodologies, which makes it difficult to identify the optimal combination of technical, economic and environmental alternatives. In this project, building energy simulations were conducted using SIMEB software in order to estimate the heating needs of a residential building located in the northern remote community of Umiujaq, Canada. The simulations were developed considering a 252 m2 one-floor house with 5 occupants. Several heating alternatives were studied to meet the heating needs of the building and to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels, the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and overall heating cost. These alternatives include wood pellet boilers, solar photovoltaics (PV) and geothermal heat pumps which were compared to conventional oil furnaces. An economic analysis was carried out through the development of a life cycle cost (LCC) analysis of each alternative considering environmental, technical, and economic issues. Simulation results give a residential building heating intensity of 324.39 kWh/m2 (space heating + domestic hot water). The LCC analysis shows that a mix of heating systems like geothermal heat pumps, biomass and solar PV represents an interesting alternative for Northern Québec with a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) that varies from 0.17 to 0.50 $/kWh, depending on the mix of technologies and their contribution to the heating needs. Conventional heating system based on fuel oil have a comparable cost of 0.21 $/kWh. Results could eventually be extended to similar subarctic settings in Canada and worldwide. © 2022 Geothermal Resources Council. All rights reserved.},

Its main objective and contribution concern the proposal of a generalized methodological structure involving multiobjective optimization techniques aimed at providing a solution to a practical problem, such as the design and dimensioning of a solar thermal system. The analysis is based on system operation data provided by a dynamic simulation model, leading to the development of multiple surrogate models of the thermal system. The thermal system surrogate models correlate the desired optimization objectives with thermal system design and operation parameters while additional surrogate models of the Pareto frontiers are generated. The implementation of the methodology is demonstrated through the optimal design and operation parameter dimensioning of a solar-assisted geothermal heat pump that provides domestic hot water loads of an office building. Essentially, energy consumption is optimized for a desired domestic hot water thermal load coverage. Implementation of reverse-engineering methods allows the determination of the system parameters representing the optimized criteria. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In the UK, heating systems are the most prominent contributor to residential energy demand, with about 80% of the share. Their representation has thus been at the core of all UK-focussed Housing Stock Energy Models (HSEMs). However, these HSEMs estimate heating demand based on monthly or annual energy balances, with correspondingly approximate representations of heating systems and practices (incl. energy conversion, distribution and spatiotemporal control). This paper describes an extension to the dynamic HSEM: EnHub, to rigorously simulate space heating and hot-water components (i.e. heaters, boilers, pumps, radiators, end-point registers, thermostats, taps). Baseline simulations estimate the English housing stock's energy use as 35.9 mtoe. Alternative scenarios in which heating systems are substituted across the board to district heating or ground-source heat pumps predict a reduction in demand to 30 and 18 mtoe respectively; the latter potentially being zero-carbon if the power sector is successfully decarbonised.

The ground source heat pump only uses the shallow geothermal resources of the earth's surface (usually less than 400 meters deep) as cold and heat source, it takes less effect on earth and its environment. The GSHPS could replace air-conditioner heater and domestic hot water facilities. The running process of GSHPS is green without any pollution.

The system does not consume water or pollute water, no boiler, no cooling towers, does not need stacked fuel waste sites. It leads significant environmental benefits.

After the validation with the measured data of electricity and gas, the energy simulation was used to model the newly constructed community building. A combined passive and active design strategy was applied to improve the energy performance. To offset the energy use for the domestic hot water, possible renewable energy systems such as the PV system, the solar thermal system, and the geothermal heat pump system were reviewed and their efficiency was analyzed.

	abstract = {                             The paper presents the annual results of monitoring a hybrid heat source consisting of a condensing gas boiler, ground and air heat pump, and solar collectors. A boiler with a nominal heat output of 186 kW works with an 81.1 kW ground-source heat pump, a 27.4 kW air-to-water heat pump and six solar collectors. The hybrid heat source is located in the fire brigade building to provide heat for space heating and ventilation and to supply domestic hot water. The annual monitoring results of the hybrid heat source were analysed in detail. The entire heat plant was equipped with measuring instruments enabling determination of heat output of individual devices, average boiler efficiency in the heating and summer season, the heating seasonal performance factor for ground and air heat pump, gas consumption by the boiler and electricity consumption by individual devices. The heat energy produced by individual devices was determined for a given period. Selected results of the economic analysis are also discussed. The annual costs of purchasing gas and electricity consumed by heat pumps were compared. Boiler efficiency as a function of parameters characteristic for a hybrid heat source was presented. The use of ground and air-source heat pumps and solar collectors reduced the consumption of natural gas during the year by 21,621 m                             3                             . As a consequence of the reduced natural gas consumption, the carbon dioxide emissions decreased during the year by 13.32 Mg.                          © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The town-hall building (Rathaus im Stühlinger: RIS) of the city of Freiburg (D) has been designed and built with the objective of a plus-energy balance and has been handed over to the city in November 2017. With a net floor area (NFA) of 22.650 m 2, it is to date one of the largest designed and built plus-energy building in Europe. The boundaries considered in the annual energy balance are limited to the loads of the heating, ventilation and cooling systems (HVAC), of the domestic hot water (DHW) and of the lighting; user-dependent energy demands are not considered. To achieve a positive primary energy balance, the building envelope is highly insulated, the energy supply is based on a low-exergy concept and onsite energy is generated by a large Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) plant combined with photovoltaic-thermal combined collectors (PVT). The central component of the heat generation is a ground-water coupled heat pump system supplying thermal activated concrete slabs, heating ceilings and air handling units (AHUs). Cooling is ensured over the geothermal well. To the date of this publication, the building has been intensively monitored for one-and-a-half year. Here, we present the energy concept as well as the results of the first monitoring period and provide an assessment of the energy balance in comparison to the plus-energy objective as well as an initial analysis of the load curves and of the heating and cooling systems. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

	abstract = {The main objective of this article is to propose possible requirements for cost-optimal plus energy building in a cold, heating dominated climate. The open question is what is more cost-effective: reduction of energy demand or increase of production from renewable energy sources. The target of the research was to check which solution has the lowest investment and maintenance costs. The analysis was made for a single-family house located in central Poland, including three different energy standards: WT2021 with energy need for heating ≤100 kWh/(m2 year), NF40 with energy need for heating ≤40 kWh/(m2 year) and NF15 with energy need for heating ≤15 kWh/(m2 year)). Air and ground source heat pumps were used as a heat source and a photovoltaic system for the production of the electrical energy. For each case the investment and running costs were calculated very precisely, taking into account heating, ventilation, domestic hot water and auxiliary systems. Global cost for a 30-year period showed that house variants with air source heat pumps are more cost effective. The investment, replacement and maintenance cost related with energy systems have the biggest share in the global cost. Reaching the plus energy standard was possible only in the case of low-energy standard NF40 and NF15. Based on this research the proposed requirements for plus energy single-family residential buildings in central Poland are the following: the final (delivered) electrical energy demand (including heating, ventilation, domestic hot water and auxiliary systems) <45 kWh/(m2 year) and the on-site electrical energy production >45 kWh/(m2 year). © 2019 by the author.

	abstract = {Thermal energy for space heating and for domestic hot water use represents about a third of the overall energy demand in Germany. An alternative to non-renewable energy-based heat supply is the implementation of closed and open shallow geothermal systems, such as horizontal ground source heat pump systems, vertical ground source heat pump (vGSHP) systems and groundwater heat pump systems. Based on existing regulations and local hydrogeological conditions, the optimal site-specific system for heat supply has to be identified. In the presented technical feasibility study, various analytical solutions are tested for an urban quarter before and after building refurbishment. Geothermal heat supply rates are evaluated by providing information on the optimal system and the specific shortcomings. Our results show that standard vGSHP systems are even applicable in older and non-refurbished residential areas with a high heat demand using a borehole heat exchanger with a length of 100 m or in conjunction with multiple boreholes. After refurbishment, all studied shallow geothermal systems are able to cover the lowered heat demand. The presented analysis also demonstrates that ideally, various technological variants of geothermal systems should be evaluated for finding the optimal solution for existing, refurbished and newly developed residential areas. © 2019, The Author(s).},

Through a survey, this paper examines the views of people involved in the Greek GSHP sector, regarding existing and future adoption level of residential GSHP systems, dissemination barriers and actions that can contribute to their adoption. The conducted Categorical Principal Components Analysis (CatPCA) indicates that diffusion barriers can be classified to market and information barriers, regulatory and financial barriers, installation barriers and siting barriers, with a) lack of public awareness on the GSHP technology and its benefits, b) economic recession, c) lack of adequate subsidies or tax exemptions for the installation and d) installation cost being considered as the most significant ones. In accordance, diffusion actions that can contribute to the penetration of the technology can be categorized to regulatory and technology improvements, financial incentives and awareness activities, with tax reductions suited for GSHPs, public awareness activities on the technology and its benefits and training activities for installers being considered as the most important ones. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

The analysis indicates that consumers’ intentions are similar among the three countries, with the only statistical significant difference occurring between Spain and Portugal on the subject of WTP for the system. The socioeconomic factors that are identified to have an effect on consumers’ intentions in relation to the hybrid system are gender, income, educational level, occupation, past investments in thermal energy systems and percentage of income spent on household energy needs; the corresponding residence characteristics include location, building type, dwelling size, year of construction and existing system for space heating and DHW.

In spite of great sources of fossil fuels, Sistan province in the southeast of Iran has no gas pipelines yet and people sometimes use gas cylinders or oil products for heating of their houses. This paper aims to propose a sustainable renewable energy system to provide heating systems for residential buildings as well as domestic hot water (DHW). Five different combinations of solar assisted ground source heat pump (SAGSHP) are simulated for a residential building in the city of Zahedan, Iran. Modeling, simulation, and operation controlling have been performed in TRNSYS software and the coefficient of performance (COP), electrical power consumption of the GSHP, soil temperature, as well as building and domestic hot water temperatures for 10 years of operation have been obtained and compared. It is obtained that a 12 kW GSHP with the assisted flat solar collectors can supply space heating demand and DHW for the building throughout the winter. The maximum and minimum annual mean COP values are 3.75 and 3.52, respectively. In the best scenario for the system assisted with the solar collector, the energy consumption diminishes 8.7% compared to GSHP standalone system. © 2017},

The geothermal system is used for both space heating and cooling, and to provide for 25% of the total amount of domestic hot water. The simulations are performed with RETScreen® for four Canadian cities: Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver. For the investigated configurations, it appeared that the cost of energy and its sources, which varied greatly according to the location, are the factors that most strongly influenced the economic viability of the proposed geothermal system, while climate was only a secondary impact. The impact of carbon taxes and equivalent monetary subsidies does not significantly modify the economic outcomes for Halifax and Montreal. However, for Toronto and Vancouver, these would need to reach between 280 and 300 Can$/tCO2eq to attain economic balance. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.},

The high installation cost is a major barrier to their diffusion but, under certain conditions (climate, building use, alternative fuels, etc.), the investment can be profitable in the long term. We present a comprehensive modeling study on GCHPs, performed with the dynamic energy simulation software TRNSYS, reproducing the operating conditions of three building types (residential, office, and hotel), with two insulation levels of the building envelope (poor/good), with the climate conditions of six European cities. Simulation results highlight the driving variables for heating/cooling peak loads and yearly demand, which are the input to assess economic performance and environmental benefits of GCHPs. We found that, in Italy, GCHPs are able to reduce CO2 emissions up to 216 g CO2/year per euro spent. However, payback times are still quite high, i.e., from 8 to 20 years. This performance can be improved by changing taxation on gas and electricity and using hybrid systems, adding a fossil-fuel boiler to cover peak heating loads, thus reducing the overall installation cost compared to full-load sized GCHP systems. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Recently, Korea has become increasingly interested in unused, but possibly useful energy resources, due to the world-wide controversy over nuclear power and limitations in renewable energy production. Among these unused resources, the water that is produced in our surroundings is available as a potential energy source for heating, cooling and domestic hot water. This water is relatively stable on the supply side, available as a high-efficiency source in all seasons, and is continuously replenished without polluting the environment. This paper analyses the energy savings generated based on the actual use of a sustainable heating and cooling system that operates using the water escaping from a nearby building.

	abstract = {The capability periodically to store and release the latent heat of phase transition during melting and solidification of Phase Change Materials (PCMs) has been currently the main subject of interest with regard to cost reduction efforts for cooling, heating of interiors and Domestic Hot Water (DHW) necessary for the operation and maintenance of adequate thermal comfort in new modern as well as old renovated residential buildings. The main principle of PCMs facilities to reduce significantly the energy consumption in the building industry of the future is based on the ability of thermo-active heat exchangers to absorb and later to dissipate into the surroundings excessive heat which can be easily obtained from renewable sources (e.g. solar energy, geothermal heat, etc.) directly in a building or in its immediate vicinity. Smart interior tiling and furnishing systems can provide high energy efficiency by stabilizing the room temperature at a level ensuring sufficient thermal comfort basically governed by the thermal conductivity and heat exchange area between ceiling (respectively also wall and floor if necessary) heat exchangers (radiators) and the heat storage medium in the form of PCMs. Unfortunately, most conventional building materials, e.g. aerated concrete, bricks, gypsum, ceramic tiles, etc. are particularly characterized by very low thermal conductivity, which disadvantages them to be used for these purposes. However, highly porous metallic material such as aluminium foam prepared by powder metallurgy [10, 11] is on the contrary excellently heat conductive, which predisposes it to be used for lightweight design of supporting structure of very energy efficient indoor as well as outdoor thermo-active heat exchangers for building industry of the future. This contribution points to the possibility to apply aluminium foam for both the novel innovative roofing system to cover pitched roofs and the interior ceiling panels, with the minimum energy demands for maintaining the sufficient thermal comfort in future nearly Zero-Energy Buildings (nZEBs). © 2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Buildings consume approximately 3/4 of the total electricity generated in the United States, contributing significantly to fossil fuel emissions. Sustainable and renewable energy production can reduce fossil fuel use, but necessitates storage for energy reliability in order to compensate for the intermittency of renewable energy generation. Energy storage is critical for success in developing a sustainable energy grid because it facilitates higher renewable energy penetration by mitigating the gap between energy generation and demand. This review analyzes recent case studies - numerical and field experiments - seen by borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) in space heating and domestic hot water capacities, coupled with solar thermal energy. System design, model development, and working principle(s) are the primary focus of this analysis. A synopsis of the current efforts to effectively model BTES is presented as well. The literature review reveals that: (1) energy storage is most effective when diurnal and seasonal storage are used in conjunction; (2) no established link exists between BTES computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models integrated with whole building energy analysis tools, rather than parameter-fit component models; (3) BTES has less geographical limitations than Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) and lower installation cost scale than hot water tanks and (4) BTES is more often used for heating than for cooling applications. © 2017 by the authors.

	abstract = {In this study, a theoretical quasi-transient model is developed for detailed simulations of a carbon dioxide (CO2) direct-expansion ground source heat pump (DX-GSHP). This model combines a transient analytical model for the ground, steady-state numerical models for the borehole and the gas cooler, as well as several thermodynamic models for the remaining components of a conventional heat pump, organized in interacting subroutines to form a powerful simulation tool. Extensive validation combining experimental data and CFD-generated results was performed for the borehole before the tool was used to simulate a practical application case. Performance is investigated for a system satisfying both space heating and domestic hot water requirements of a typical single family detached home in a cold climate region. The variation of different system parameters is also evaluated in this study. It is shown that CO2 DX-GSHPs can offer relatively efficient and stable performance for integrated water and space heating applications. Furthermore, the importance of an accurate geothermal borehole sizing is highlighted for the DX-CO2 heat pump systems. It is shown that, due to changes in the system working conditions, the total borehole length is not linearly correlated with the heat pump energy consumption and other parameters such as heat pump coefficient of performance and pressure drop in ground heat exchangers. Results showed that increasing the total borehole length of an optimum design (reference case study) by 25% decreases the total annual energy consumption by only 6%. However, reducing total borehole length of the reference case by 25% increases the total annual energy consumption by 10%. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The practical feasibility of using the ground as a source of renewable energy is clearly demonstrated. Better than 75% of the energy needed for space heating was extracted from the ground. The average monthly electricity consumption for space conditioning was only 40kWh at summer and winter thermostat set points of 24.4°C and 21.7°C, respectively. The WA-GSHP shared the same 94.5m vertical bore ground loop with a separate water-to-water ground-source heat pump (WW-GSHP) for meeting domestic hot water needs in the same house. Sources of systemic irreversibility, the main cause of lost work, are identified using Exergy and energy analysis.Quantifying the sources of Exergy and energy losses is essential for further systemic improvements. The research findings suggest that the WA-GSHPs are a practical and viable technology to reduce primary energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions under the IECC 2012 Standard, as well as the European Union (EU) 2020 targets of using renewable energy resources. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The main focus area of this research paper to efficiently remove the heat generated during conversion of solar energy into electricity using photovoltaic (PV) module. The photovoltaic conversion efficiency of commercial available PV module varies in the range of 8%-20% depending on the type of solar cell materials used for the module construction, e.g. crystalline silicon, thin film, CIGS, organic, etc. During the conversion process, only a small fraction of the incident solar radiation is utilize by PV cells to produce electricity and the remaining is converted into waste heat in the module which causes the PV cell temperature to increase and its efficiency to drop. This thermal energy could be extract using air or water as a heat removal fluid to utilize in heating applications. The purpose of a solar photovoltaic module is to convert solar energy into electricity. The hybrid combination of photovoltaic module and thermal collector called Photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) module. Such PVT module combines a PV, which converts electromagnetic radiation (photons) into electricity, with a solar thermal module, which captures the remaining energy and removes waste heat from the PV module. Cooling of cells either by natural or forced circulation can reduce the PV cell temperature. The simultaneous cooling of the PV cells maintains their PV efficiency at a satisfactory level and offers a better way of utilizing solar energy by generating thermal energy as well. PVT system has higher overall efficiency as compared to separate PV and thermal collector. The heat output of a PVT module can be used for space heating or production of domestic hot water. This paper presents an innovative design of top cooling Thermal Photovoltaic (T-PV) module and its performance under outdoor weather condition of Singapore. T-PV collector is designed to flow fluid over the top of PV panel through a very narrow gap between the solar lens. This process improves heat removal process from PV panel, and hence, improves the electrical output of PV panel as compared to other PVT collector available in the market. By flowing the water from top of the PV panel will also provide better thermal efficiency. A T-PV collector system with storage tank, sensors, pump, flow meters, data logger and controls, have been installed at test-site located in Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Singapore. Performance analysis of T-PV collector system has been evaluated under the tropical climatic conditions of Singapore. It was found that T-PV module could produce additional electrical power as compared to standard PV panel of same capacity by operating at lower temperature. In addition to electricity, T-PV panel also generate the hot water up to 60 deg C at an average thermal efficiency of 41% for usage in residential and commercial buildings. The average thermal energy output was 3.1 kWh/day on typical day's basis. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.},

Extracting heat from an array of PV modules should improve the performance of both the PV cells and the heat pump. A series of computer simulations compare the performance of a ground source heat pump with a short ground circuit, used to provide space heating and domestic hot water at a house in southern England. The results indicate that extracting heat from an array of PV-thermal modules would improve the performance of a ground source heat pump with an undersized ground loop. Nevertheless, open air thermal collectors could be more effective, especially during winter. In one model more electricity was saved in ohmic heating than was generated by cooling the PV cells. Cooling the PV modules was found to increase their electrical output up to 4%, but much of the extra electricity was consumed by the cooling pumps. © 2015 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Ground coupled heat pump (GCHP) is a clean and energy-saving approach to provide air conditioning and domestic hot water. For the building with dominant heating load, more heat is extracted from the soil and thermal imbalance is becoming a crucial problem to reduce the efficiency and impede wide application of GCHP. Due to the disadvantages of the existing solutions, a GCHP system integrated with air-water heat exchanger (AHE-GCHP) is proposed and simulated to investigate its performance in this paper. AHE can not only compensate heat into the ground but also supply heat for space heating and domestic hot water in different modes through fully using the energy in air with the average COP range from 4.49 to 15.09. AHE-GCHP system keeps the thermal balance well, and saves 23.86% energy compared with traditional "boiler + split air conditioner", and costs less than half compared with "hybrid GCHP assisted with solar collector".},

	abstract = {The heat content of shallow or deep aquifers can be used for space heating. Two innovative systems are described below in detail: A geothermal heat pump system based on a single well in China (= shallow), and a cascading use of tunnel waters (= deep) in Switzerland. The "Single Well System" (HYY SWS) was invented and developed by Beijing Ever Source Science & Technology Development Co., Ltd (HYY) to provide buildings with heating and cooling as well as with domestic hot water. The powerful system operates at about 500 kWth capacity. Unlike traditional groundwater heat pump systems, in which two wells are used (one for pumping groundwater out and the other to dispose of cooled water), the HYY SWS uses only one, specially designed well for production and reinjection. A borehole with a depth of about 70-80 m and a diameter of 0.5 m is drilled for HYY Single Well Systems. The necessary local geologic site condition is to have a shallow aquifer with a hydraulic conductivity of 10-3 m/sec or higher. Many such systems operate now in China, several of which, for instance, serve the 2008 Summer Olympic Facilities in Beijing. Switzerland has, in its mountainous parts, hundreds of deep tunnels. Tunnels drain the rock overburden and, depending on its thickness, water temperatures up to 50 °C can be encountered and utilized. The most straightforward and cheapest form of tunnel heat usage is to collect and transport inflowing waters via ducts to the portals, with as little temperature drop as possible. The thermal power depends on flow rate and temperature. At or near the portals the heat content of the waters can be used for various applications. When the temperature level of the tunnel water outflows is too low for direct applications (e.g. for district heating), heat pumps are employed. From Switzerland a whole suite of uses can be reported: space heating, greenhouses, balneology and wellness, fish farming. At the northern portal of the 35 km long Loetschberg base tunnel at Frutigen, the tunnel water is used subsequently ("cascading") for space heating, greenhouse, and fish farming (incl. caviar production). © 2015 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.},

	abstract = {A solar assisted ground source heat pump (SAGSHP) system is a promising technology which pairs two widely abundant renewable energy sources, solar and shallow geothermal. In space heating dominated regions, the addition of solar collectors to conventional ground source systems improves their feasibility. There are many aspects which influence the system's efficiency; but experimentation to optimize these would requires high capital investment and take a very long time. Therefore, mathematical modeling and computer-based simulations are preferable methods to conduct sensitivity and feasibility analyses. In this work, a PVT based solar assisted ground source heat pump system was modeled using TRNSYS program, and sensitivity analyses were conducted. For the PVT collectors, an experimentally verified transient model was utilized, while experimental data were used to validate a novel very shallow borefield. For the heat pump model, manufacturer's performance data along with a new novel method were combined, and a new component was created in the simulation platform. A single family dwelling with domestic hot water demand was assumed for the heating load, and weather data from Birmingham, West Midlands, UK was used. The simulation results were evaluated by utilizing the annual specific productivity metric rather than the systems seasonal performance factor, which is the current choice for SAGSHP systems. The proposed evaluation approach was found be capable of clarifying, in detail, the effect of the parametric variation on the system's energy performance. The sensitivity analyses are focused on six parameters on the energy conversion side, with the heat pump's evaporator as the physical boundary. It was found that the storage capacity and the plate heat exchanger's effectiveness, contribute the most to the system's and PVTs’ heat productivity. Whilst heat productivity depended more on the parameters’ variation, the power generation was influenced mainly by the collectors’ tilt. The results of this study are significant for design and operation of these systems. © 2019 International Solar Energy Society},

From the exergy point of view, low DH supply temperature also better matches the exergy demand of space heating and domestic hot water. It is more beneficial to operate district heating system under lower temperature level for the heat-sparse area where the distribution losses accounts for a large proportion in the total heat supply. In this study, the actual performance of a case ultra-low temperature district heating (ULTDH) system in Denmark was investigated based on long-term measurements. The system combines the central heat pump and local boosters, while the impact of such configuration on the overall system performance was analysed. The energy, exergy and economy performances of the case system were compared to medium temperature district heating system (MTDH) and low-temperature district heating system (LTDH). The results show that the LTDH system without supplementary heating has the highest energy and exergy efficiency. While the ULTDH system has better performance compared to the MTDH system in energy, exergy and economy due to substantial savings from the distribution heat loss. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Renewable energy is increasingly used in the building nowadays, how to scientifically evaluate the renewable energy utilization efficiency is a problem worthy of study. Considering extra conventional energy consumption, based on exergy analysis method, a general formula is proposed to evaluate the utilization efficiency of the building renewable energy. The evaluation indexes of substitution rate are deduced, which is divided into two categories. One is for single kind of renewable energy output, another is for multi-output, which can get two or more cooling, heating or domestic hot water by the same renewable energy system. The building common renewable energy system ground source heat pump (GSHP) for heating and cooling, and solar thermal system for heating are analyzed in this paper with the method. The results show that for single kind of renewable energy output, if the exergy efficiency of conventional energy system is greater than the renewable energy system, the renewable energy substitution rate must be less than zero, which means the renewable energy utilization shouldn't be encouraged. For renewable energy multi-output, if the substitution rate for one kind of output is minus, another kind of output is greater than zero, the total substitution rate may be more than or less than zero, which should be calculated to estimate the renewable energy utilization is reasonable or not. For ground source heat pump(GSHP) system, the higher the efficiency of the conventional energy system, the less obvious the substitution of renewable energy is. For solar thermal system, the main factor affecting substitution rate is solar fraction ratio. © 2018},

In quest for higher efficiencies, it is not always possible to meet all of these demands where environmental footprint often gets secondary attention. This paper presents a novel SH system which is capable of meeting all of the aforementioned elements while simultaneously proving SH and domestic hot water (DHW). The system comprises a geothermal sourced heat pump (HP) featuring "hot gas water" (HGW) technology which delivers higher efficiency. This paper gives a thorough thermodynamic assessment of the system covering component based first and second law analysis and provides test results based on two case studies at a house (W10/W35) and a renovated building (W10/W45). The results show that a theoretical efficiency gain by 11.02% is achievable where the source temperature is 10 °C and the water temperature for floor heating is 35 °C. For the same system, with the same source temperature but with a supply temperature of 45 °C for SH, an efficiency gain of 17.91% is achievable. From experimental testing of the system using the test stand at GeoTherma, 4.73% efficiency gain with water temperature of 35 °C and 3.59% efficiency gain with water temperature of 45 °C were obtained. Economic analysis results showed that savings of up to 10% on an annual basis is possible with HGW technology installed in an average family house, whereas it gets 4.36% for a small hotel with a payback time period of about 9 yrs.

For space heating solutions, currently in urban areas of north China, coal based district heating is prevalent. In urban areas of south China, distributed heating solutions are used. In rural areas, de-centralized coal stoves and biomass stoves are still commonly used. As renewable building heating solution, ground source heat pumps are installed for large scale applications. Building floor areas heated by ground source heat pumps increased tremendously during past ten years. Air source heat pump is being promoted in north Chinese rural areas as part of coal to clean heating project. Solar water heater and electric water heater for domestic hot water supply is widely used in north China and gas water boiler is widely used in south China. A series of policies have encouraged clean fossil fuel district heating in north China. National development plans are also supporting and subsidizing renewable heating technology such as heat pumps. Different building heating technologies have their own advantages and disadvantages from techno-economic and environmental perspectives. The choice of building heating solutions for different geolocations of China is strongly affected by spatial parameters such as local climate condition, population distribution, natural resource availability etc. Therefore, a spatial data analysis method is essential to help stakeholders decide proper building heating solutions in different parts of China by key performance indicators reflecting lower primary energy use, economic affordability and lower environmental impact. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {For the new housing area with approx. 130 low energy residential houses, located in Kassel, Germany, various supply concepts are investigated. Main objective of the project is the development of an innovative and optimised heat supply concept based on renewable energies and a low temperature district heating for later realisation. During the course of the project several heat supply concepts have been investigated and compared to give an input to the decision and realisation process. A promising heat supply concept is based on a central ground source heat pump in combination with a low temperature district heating (40°C supply temperature) for space heating and decentralised solar thermal systems for domestic hot water preparation. The advantages of this supply variant are comparable low annual heating costs and about 60% lower CO2-emissions in comparison to the reference system (decentralized air / water heat pump with solar thermal system). Due to time constrains it was decided not to realise the above mentioned energy concept. However, the research project took up the task to investigate the transferability of the concept in technological and economical perspectives to other locations and boundary conditions. From the results of the study the importance of a very high connection rate can be highlighted. Also the question of the particular business models for such capital demanding projects (high investment costs for the heating grid vs. low energy demand/sales) has been regarded. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

	abstract = {Approximately 70% of the total population of Oradea benefits from centralized heating, about 55,000 apartments and 159,000 inhabitants are connected. The heating system of Oradea consists of: sources of thermal energy production (Combined heat and power (CHP) I Oradea and geothermal water heating plants); a transport network of heat; heat distribution network for heating and domestic hot water; substations, most of them equipped with worn and obsolete equipment. Recently, only a few heat exchangers were rehabilitated and electric valves were installed to control the water flow. After heat extraction, geothermal chilled waters from the Oradea area are: discharged into the sewer system of the city, paying a fee to the local water company which manages the city's sewers; discharged into the small river Peta; or re-injected into the reservoir. In order to ensure environmental protection and a sustainable energy development in Oradea, renewable sources of energy have been promoted in recent years. In this respect, the creation of a new well for geothermal water re-injection into the reservoir limits any accidental thermal pollution of the environment, while ensuring the conservation properties of the aquifer by recharging with geothermal chilled water. The paper presents the achievements of such a project whose aim is to replace thermal energy obtained from coal with geothermal heating. The novelty consists in the fact that within the substation we will replace old heat exchangers, circulation pumps and valves with fully automated substations operating in parallel on both a geothermal system and on a primary heating system of a thermal plant. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The hybrid system operates at the ideal performance, but the design and operation method for hybrid system have not been established. In this paper, the performance of the hybrid system combined with photovoltaic/thermal (PVT) system and ground source heat pump (GSHP) system was analyzed using TRNSYS 17 and feasibility was assessed. The energy consumption and performance efficiency of hybrid system were calculated according to operating modes. Furthermore, seasonal performance factor (SPF) of hybrid system was compared with that of conventional GSHP system. System performance was analyzed in various conditions such as the usage of storage tank heating and set temperature for solar heating. As a result, the average SPF of the developed system increased about 55.3% compared with the GSHP system. © 2017 by the authors.},

In China, general public's participation and concern for policy making played a less role in the past. However, with the development of people's conscience on a qualified living quality, general people's awareness towards the policy making on the production of subsurface energy increases greatly in recent years. Questionnaire investigation was carried out in this paper, demonstrating that the high educated people are concerned with the utilization of the renewable energy. However, the geothermal energy is less familiar by the general public compared with solar and wind energy in their daily life. Compared with the district space heating system, the ground source heat pump is very limited for the household heating method in winter. Market acceptance is high for the geothermal power and direct utilization (e.g. geothermal heating system and domestic hot water from geothermal source) for the consumers and government investors. The socio-political support by the high educated public on the production of geothermal energy is high. However, because there is no deep (e.g. several km) geothermal power project in China, it is difficult to know the attitude of the potential affected people when the reservoir stimulation technology (e.g. hydraulic fracturing) is used.                          © 2018 International Journal of Caring Sciences.

Decreasing the overall cost of a ground source heat pump system is equally challenging. An effort to address both issues at once has been made in relation to groundwater ingress in the Glasgow Subway system. Inflowing water is a valuable resource which could be channelled through a water source heat pump (WSHP) to produce heat energy for domestic or public use (heating and domestic hot water). Water flow and water temperature have been recorded for a year at 21 different points within the network of the underground tunnels and platforms. The points of highest water influx were identified, and the heat energy content of each has been calculated. Working from these data, several options were identified for capturing the water and diverting it to a WSHP to recover heat. A final design for a pilot system within the tunnels was developed. The findings of this study are expected to contribute a renewable heat solution through a cost-effective heat pump system design. © 2018 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The renewable energy has drawn increasingly attention for the utilization of energy in the worldwide, especially biomass and geothermal energy. The total biomass gasification usually leads to the higher exergy destruction and lower exergy efficiency of gasification process subsequently, and the flue gas at middle temperature (400 °C) is always used to generate domestic hot water from environment temperature to required temperature e.g. 55 °C, the relative large temperature difference leads to high exergy loss. For adopting ground source heat pump system to generate domestic hot water, relative high target temperature (e.g. 55 °C) always leads to the high compression ratio, which decreases the coefficient of performance (COP) of the ground source heat pump host. Therefore, so as to make a better use of biomass and increase the COP of ground source heat pump systems, a novel CHP system coupling biomass partial gasification and ground source heat pump is presented. It mainly consists of four parts: biomass partial gasification subsystem; gas turbine power generation subsystem; steam turbine power generation subsystem; and ground source heat pump subsystem. The main products of proposed system are electricity and domestic hot water (55 °C). The exergetic and exergoeconomic performance analysis of proposed system are investigated, and in a further way, the effects of several key system integrating parameters on system performance are also studied. The results show that the system exergy efficiency can be reached at about 13.65%. The main exergy destruction exists in gasifier and followed by char boiler, which accounts for 38% and 21.71% of total exergy destruction, respectively. Moreover, the unit cost of hot water, power generated by gas turbine and steam turbine are 92.5 $/GJ, 12.4 $/GJ and 23.9 $/GJ, respectively. The proposed CHP integration system is valuable to other advanced biomass and geothermal based multi-generation systems. © 2017},

	abstract = {In this paper a novel low temperature district heating and cooling system based on renewable energy sources is investigated by means of a dynamic simulation model and an energy-economic analysis. A novel solution consisting of geothermal, solar and biomass energy sources integration is considered. Low enthalpy geothermal well, evacuated solar collectors and auxiliary wood-chip boiler are used to supply the district heating system during the winter season. During summer, an adsorption chiller is activated in order to provide district cooling, while during all year, the system produces domestic hot water for the district users. The case study is developed for the district area of Monterusciello, near the city of Pozzuoli, in Southern Italy. For the case study under investigation, a geothermal source is available at about 55 °C with typical irradiance conditions of Mediterranean climate. A rehabilitation of the buildings located in the considered district area is considered. The proposed system is modelled in TRNSYS environment, where a novel and detailed control strategy is implemented in order to manage the system operation and to match the thermal energy demand of the district users. A comprehensive model of the district network and a detailed heating and cooling demand of network users are considered in the dynamic simulation model of the system. A 1-year simulation is performed and the system performance is analyzed with daily, weekly and yearly time bases. The system analysis is completed with a sensitivity analysis, performed in order to evaluate the system energy and economic profitability as a function of the solar collector field area. The results outline that geothermal and solar energy are only used to match the thermal demand of the district users during winter, while only during summer the activation of the auxiliary biomass boiler is mandatory to match the space cooling demand. The novel system achieves a satisfactory yearly performance in terms of solar collector field efficiency (above 40%) and adsorption chiller Coefficient of Performance (0.5). The system is not economically feasible without any public funding (Simple Pay Back of 20.9 years), while a significant primary energy ratio is achieved (above 75%). In case of public funding policies, the Simple Pay Back period can be halved. © 2017},

	abstract = {The market share of building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) remains limited. One of the main barriers to its larger adoption is its initial capital cost, as BIPV is generally more expensive than traditional roof or façade mounted photovoltaic modules (PV). Converting BIPV systems into BIPV with thermal energy recovery (BIPV-T) can improve its benefit and competitiveness compared to other solar energy technologies. This benefit is difficult to estimate, however, as it strongly depends on the usefulness of the thermal energy produced and the incremental cost of the technology to recover the heat. This study aims at evaluating the cost-benefit of BIPV-T focusing on systems that use air as the heat recovery fluid and are integrated into all-electric energy-efficient homes located in heating dominated climates. This cost-benefit is evaluated using the concept of break-even cost defined as the maximum incremental cost to convert a BIPV system into a BIPV-T system to break-even with the cost of (a) a BIPV system and (b) side-by-side PV modules and solar thermal collectors (PV + T). To obtain this cost, the useful equivalent energy production of BIPV, BIPV-T and PV + T systems was first obtained for six energy-efficient housing archetypes located in various cities across Canada. Four different heat management scenarios were considered for the BIPV-T system: (1) fresh air preheating, (2) domestic hot water preheating through an air-to-water heat exchanger, (3) domestic hot water and space heating with an air-to-water heat pump and (4) domestic hot water heating (DHW) with a heat pump water heater. Compared to BIPV, BIPV-T systems always produce more useful energy and as a result, the break-even cost compared to a BIPV system was found to be always positive and up to 2700 CAD for a medium 2-storey home located in Montreal. For that same house and considering the price of BIPV equal to that of standard roof-mounted PV modules, the break-even cost of a BIPVT system compared to a PV + T system was estimated at 4200 CAD. If the price of BIPV were to get 10% lower than PV, however, this break-even cost could increase to 6400 CAD. © 2016},

	abstract = {Plus-energy houses have until now been frontrunners: they are very often detached houscs or buildings in sparsely populated areas. But due to the on-going urban sprawl new solutions must be developed. The focus should be on the development of innovative multifunctional neighhourhoods using energetic synergies of building clusters. The key objective of the '+ERS - Plus Energy Network Reininghaus South" is the development of a comprehensive energy concept in the context of urban, thermal and building engineering for an entire city district. A combination of energy efficiency measures, energy production on site and energy exchange between the buildings will establish a plus energy housing estate. The project comprises an approximately I 7,000 sqm area providing work and living space for 500 people. Due to the different load and user profiles exchange of surplus energy between this two building complexes is possible. In winter energy supply for domestic hot water and space heating for the twelve residential buildings is provided by a geothermal system with ground tubes and heat pumps. In summer the ground tubes are used as a heat sink for the office and shop buildings. This paper highlights the main technical measures and strategies, the results of a Life Cycle Analysis (LCA), the results of the dynamic simulation of the Plus Energy Network, and also discusses the problems and hurdles of implementation.},

This paper investigates the energy and environmental potential of a renewable trigeneration system in a residential application under Incheon (Korea) and Ottawa (Canada) weather conditions. The trigeneration system consists of a ground-to-air heat exchanger (GAHX), photovoltaic thermal (PVT) panels and an air-to-water heat pump (AWHP). The study is performed by simulations in TRNSYS (Version 17.02) environment. The performance of the trigeneration system is compared to a reference conventional system that utilizes a boiler for space and domestic hot water heating and a chiller for space cooling. Simulation results showed substantial annual primary energy savings from the renewable trigeneration system in comparison to the reference system—45% for Incheon and 42% for Ottawa. The CO2eq emission reduction from the renewable trigeneration system is also significant, standing at 43% for Incheon and 82% for Ottawa. Furthermore, trigeneration systems’ capability to generate electricity and thermal energy at the point of use is considered as an attractive option for inclusion in the future smart energy network applications. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

At the same time, the solar energy is the renewable source for excellence. In this study, different combinations of a photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector (PVT) and a multi-source heat pump for space heating and domestic hot water (DHW) production have been investigated. The air, solar and ground heat sources for the heat pump were analysed. The case study regards the heat demand of a single-family house building located in north-east of Italy. The considered system configurations have been investigated by means of the simulation tool TRNSYS coupled to a dedicated mathematical model for the estimation of the electrical and thermal performances of solar panels. This model is based on the equivalent electrical circuit. As a result, all the investigated multi-source systems reported an increase of energy efficiency between 14% and 26% compared to a standard air to water heat pump system. The system with air and solar sources has an energy efficiency equal to 3.64, slightly lower than that obtained for the more complex systems. © 2016 WIT Press, www.witpress.com.},

	abstract = {Underground thermal imbalance is a significant problem for ground-coupled heat pump (GCHP) systems that serve predominately heated buildings in cold regions, which extract more heat from the ground and inject less heat, especially in buildings requiring domestic hot water (DHW). To solve this problem, a previously developed heat compensation unit with thermosyphon (HCUT) is integrated with a GCHP unit to build a hybrid GCHP system. To improve the energy savings of this hybrid GCHP system, the HCUT unit is set to have multiple functions (heat compensation, direct DHW and direct space heating) in this paper. To analyze the improved system performance, a hotel requiring air-conditioning and DHW is selected and simulated in three typical cold cities using the dynamic software DeST and TRNSYS. The results indicate that the hybrid GCHP system can maintain the underground thermal balance while keeping the indoor air temperature within the design range. Furthermore, the HCUT unit efficiently reduces the energy consumption via its multi-functional operations. Compared to the previous system that only used HCUT for heat compensation, adding the direct DHW function further saves 7.5-11.0% energy in heat compensation (HC) and DHW (i.e., 3.6-4.8% of the whole system). Simultaneously adding the direct DHW and space heating functions to the HCUT can save 9.8-12.9% energy in HC and DHW (i.e., 5.1-6.0% of the whole system). The hybrid GCHP system with a multi-functional HCUT provides more energy savings while maintaining the underground thermal balance in cold regions that demand both air-conditioning and DHW. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Benefits are analyzed in terms of levelized cost and site energy use. Two district-based scenarios, served by a central ground source heat pump and a central electric boiler with individual air conditioning units, are compared against a decentralized business as usual scenario with individual electric space heaters, air conditioning units and storage-type electric water heaters. Electricity use and levelized cost were modeled in TRNSYS. For a 3-dwelling system with total thermal energy demand of 14.2 MW h/y and peak load of 12.7 kW, the district ground source heat pump configuration uses less electrical energy and power. However, the business as usual system has the lowest levelized cost due to the high cost of the ground-source heat pump installation. Levelized cost was most sensitive to capital cost and number of dwellings connected to the system for the district configurations considered. A 30% decrease in capital cost of the district system resulted in 21% average decrease of levelized cost, while a 100% increase in the number of dwellings resulted in an average 17% decrease of cost. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {This paper presents the design, simulation and optimisation of a small trigeneration plant supplied by geothermal and solar energies. Different technologies are implemented in a dynamic simulation model purposely developed for research scope: a 6kWe micro Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC); a 30kWf single stage H2O/LiBr absorption chiller; a geothermal well a solar field obtained by new prototypal flat-plate evacuated solar collectors. The ORC is supplied by heat obtained by a geothermal well in which geothermal brine is about at 95°C. In order to improve system performance, additional heat is provided by solar energy obtained through a 25m2 solar field. Diathermic oil (up to 130°C) is adopted as working fluid in order to supply heat to the ORC evaporator. A suitable oil storage tank is modelled in order to mitigate the temperature fluctuations due to the variability of solar energy availability. The output power of the ORC depends on the availability of solar energy. The absorption chiller is switched-on in summer time and it is fed by geothermal energy only. This simulation model is implemented in TRNSYS environment. The ORC is modelled by zero-dimensional energy and mass balances implemented in Engineering Equation Solver (EES).A case study is developed in order to test the energy and economic performance of this innovative micro-trigeneration plant. In particular, the above mentioned model is applied to the Regina Isabella hotel in Ischia (Naples, South Italy), famous for its geothermal sources. Currently, such hotel is already equipped by a geothermal system (by several hot water wells) for thermal cares, domestic hot water production and space heating. By TRNSYS the optimisation of the system design parameters and the calculation of the thermo-economic conditions were performed. The system showed excellent energy performance indexes. In fact, the average yearly efficiency of the solar thermal collectors is close to 60%, whereas the average yearly ORC electric efficiency is about 6%, which is a good achievement considering the system driving temperature. Results also show that the system performance is more dependent on the availability of the geothermal energy than the solar one. From the economic point of view, good results are also obtained. In fact, in the worst operating conditions the Simple Pay Back Period is 7.6. years, decreasing to 2.5. years in the most convenient considered scenario (public funding and full utilisation of the produced thermal energy). © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper presents a working methodology and develops an analytical model for evaluation of the ground thermal conductivity and the borehole thermal resistance using a thermal response test (TRT). Additionally, this paper uses the Earth Energy Designer (EED) simulation program developed on the basis of the line-source model to calculate the fluid temperature for a case study of the ground heat exchanger according to the monthly heating and cooling loads and the borehole thermal resistance. Through the ground TRT, the length of the loops is properly determined, the operating performance of the system is provided, and supplementary costs (e.g. extra loops, boreholes, glycol, etc.) are avoided. The average fluid temperature in the ground for cooling, heating and domestic hot water production thermal power over a period of 25 years was simulated. Analysing the time evolution of the fluid temperatures in the ground for the peak loads reveals that these values are approximately constant, meaning that the heat source (ground) is fully regenerated and thus the GCHP will maintain high performance in operation. © SGEM2017.

The Taupo Hospital sits in the south-east of the Taupo township located on the outflow zone from the Wairakei-Tauhara geothermal system. The direct-use of geothermal energy in the hospital was commissioned in August 2010 to provide space heating and domestic hot water supplies. Previously, two coal fired boilers that consumed around 340 t/year of coal were used. By converting to geothermal energy, significant savings were made in terms of operation (fuel) and maintenance costs, while no greenhouse gases are emitted to the environment. Geothermal fluid production fluctuates depending on the season. Minimum production during summer is 59 t/day and maximum production during winter is 279. t/day. The geothermal and heat exchanger system has now been running for more than four years, with no issues pertaining to scaling and corrosion. This is due to a combination of good maintenance practices and the favourable chemical composition of the geothermal fluid. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

The method is based on step-based heating of DHW, where the DHW is gradually heated from the inlet temperature of domestic cold water to the target temperature of DHW using a specifically designed GSHP system concept. The developed method was tested and validated using experimental and computational performance analyses and the energy efficiency, operation and potential limitations of the developed application were also studied in existing apartment buildings. To demonstrate the efficiency of the developed application, the performance of the new concept was compared to the performance of a conventionally used GSHP system. The results demonstrated that the developed GSHP concept delivered up to 45–50% improvement in energy efficiency of the DHW heating process over the conventional GSHP application. The measured Seasonal Performance Factors were 2.5–2.6 for the conventional application and as high as 3.7–3.8 for the developed application, when DHW was heated from 7.5 °C to 55 °C. The case study demonstrated that the developed concept is also well applicable in existing buildings, but there is still room for improvement. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES) is one way to increase heating efficiency. ATES systems in shallow geothermal configurations have the ability to reduce heating and cooling costs of buildings by 20-40%, with as associated reduction in GHG emissions. The efficiency of an ATES system depends in part on the thermal front growth, which can be investigated to a first-order approximation by thermo-hydraulic modeling. In this study we addressed parameters such as the well-spacing and water flowrate that affect the thermal front to avoid premature thermal breakthrough by defining a dimensionless ratio η. The area of study is located in the Williston Basin, as a sub-basin of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). Stress and strain changes due to fluid flow are enhancements of this model, executed using a finite element computational platform. Results show that increasing flowrate increases the length of heat propagation and stress/strain magnitude but increasing well spacing has the opposite effect. Copyright 2018 ARMA.},

In this paper, conventional GSHPS, and GSHPS with different heat recovery ratios, in a typical city were compared based on thermal imbalance ratios, average soil temperatures and soil temperature increases. The transient system simulation software was used to simulate the operation performance of GSHPS. The thermal imbalance ratio and soil temperature decreased with increasing heat recovery ratio. After 20 years of operation, the soil thermal imbalance ratios of the GSHPS were 29.2%, 21.1%, 16%, and 5.2%, and the soil temperature rises were 8.78 °C, 5.25 °C, 3.44 °C, and 0.34 °C, while the heat recovery ratios were 0, 18%, 30% and 53%, respectively.

The current study examines a multi-source energy system equipped with photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collectors, two storage tanks for the heat source and the domestic hot water respectively and heat pumps for the space heating and domestic hot water production of a single-family dwelling located in North East Italy. Air, solar, and ground source heat pumps were analysed. Some configurations were investigated utilizing computer simulations based on a mathematical model developed to evaluate the electrical and thermal performances of hybrid solar collectors. A smart control unit capable of identifying the best heat source for the heat pump and of considering the possibility of injecting heat harvested by solar collectors into the ground during the summer period was analysed. The investigation uncovered that the multi-energy source systems were responsible for increasing the energy efficiency by 16–25% with respect to an ordinary air to water heat pump system. The simulations also revealed that the energy efficiency of the air-solar source system was slightly lower than that linked to the other configurations including a ground source heat pump. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

The supply energy system was proposed to a 202 m2 single-family demo dwelling (SFD), which is defined by the Norwegian Zero Emission Building standard. The main design parameters were analyzed in order to find the most essential parameters, which could significantly influenced the total energy use. This study found that 85% of the total heating demand of the SFD was covered by renewable energy. The results showed that the solar energy generated by the system could cover 85-92% and 12-70% of the domestic hot water demand in summer and winter respectively. In addition, the solar energy may cover 2.5-100% of the space heating demand. The results showed that the supply air volume, supply air and zone set point temperatures, auxiliary electrical volume, volume of the DHW tank, orientation and tilt angle and the collector area could influenced mostly the total energy use. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {One of the oldest energy efficiency ideas, the combined heat and power (CHP), is prospering in the US and looks promising elsewhere as the world searches for low-cost energy by increasing efficiency while lowering CO2 emissions. According to a recent report released by Transparency Market Research, the global CHP installation market was valued at $806.2 billion in 2017 and is projected to reach $1,131.4 billion by 2026, a compound annual growth rate of 3.8%. CHP systems consist of electric generation, most typically from natural gas, but also from diesel, coal, biomass, solar, geothermal, or nuclear, with a system that captures the heat that’s produced and typically lost. The excess heat, often steam, can be used for heating, and ever more frequently cooling, and domestic hot water. The US DOE has a long-stated goal of having 20% of generating capacity from CHP. According to a 2015 POWER analysis of CHP around the world, entitled Global CHP Still Struggling to Break Out of Its Niche”, despite its efficiency and environmental benefits, CHP generation has languished at around 10% of worldwide capacity for more than a decade. International Energy Agency statistics showed that in 1990, global electricity production from CHP amounted to about 14% of the total. By 2000, CHP had dipped to 10%, where it has remained mostly stable since. In the European Union, for example, CHP in 2017 accounted for 11% of electric generation.},

	abstract = {There is a continuous growth of heat pump installations in residential buildings in Germany. The heat pumps are not only used for space heating and domestic hot water consumption but also to offer flexibility to the grid. The high coefficient of performance and the low cost of heat storages made the heat pumps one of the optimal candidates for the power to heat applications. Thus, several questions are raised about the optimal integration and control of heat pump system with buffer storages to maximize its operation efficiency and minimize the operation costs. In this paper, an experimental investigation is performed to study the performance of a ground source heat pump (GSHP) with a combi-storage under several configurations and control factors. The experiments were performed on an innovative modular testbed that is capable of emulating a ground source to provide the heat pump with different temperature levels at different times of the day. Moreover, it can emulate the different building loads such as the space heating load and the domestic hot water consumption in real-time. The data gathered from the testbed and different experimental studies were used to develop a simulation model based on Modelica that can accurately simulate the dynamics of a GSHP in a building. The model was validated based on different metrics. Energetically, the difference between the developed model and the measured values was only 3% and 4% for the heat generation and electricity consumption, respectively. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Biomass and geothermal energy are becoming promising traditional energy alternatives. For biomass utilization with thermal-chemical gasification technologies, adopting total gasification scheme always leads to large exergy destruction and low thermal efficiency. Besides that, in typical biomass based combined heating and power systems, the flue gas at middle temperature is usually utilized to produce domestic hot water directly, which also leads to large exergy loss for relative large energy grade difference. In the light of geothermal energy utilization, i.e. ground source heat pump systems, for the relative high temperature required of output stream, a relative high compression ratio is required accordingly, which leads to a low coefficient of performance of ground source heat pump. In order to solve the above referred problems, a novel heating and power co-generation system coupling biomass partial gasification and ground source heat pump is proposed and analyzed in this study. The proposed system consists of four subsystems: biomass partial gasification subsystem; gas turbine power generation subsystem; steam turbine power generation subsystems; and ground source heat pump subsystem. The features of this novel system focus on: only part of the biomass is gasified not all (partial gasification), the syngas and un-reacted char are used as fuels for gas turbine (Brayton cycle) and steam turbine (Rankine cycle) power generation respectively; in the ground source heat pump subsystem, the temperature of required water is reduced to 39 °C instead of 55 °C, and will be further reheated to 55 °C by flue gas at middle temperature from biomass based combined heating and power subsystem. The thermodynamic performance of the proposed system is numerically investigated. The results indicate that the proposed system can make a better use of biomass and geothermal energy, which can achieve an overall energy efficiency of 72.12% with a heat to power ratio 3.93, and the coefficient of performance of ground source heat pump subsystem can be improved to 5.6 with the compression ratio 3.2. What's more, the system integrating mechanism in this study is very helpful for other advanced biomass based and multi-energy coupling systems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

The proposed system utilizes geothermal energy and solar energy to provide space cooling and heating as well as domestic hot water (DHW), and offsets the need of grid electricity by generating electricity from the PV cells. A dynamic simulation system is developed using TRNSYS and used to facilitate the performance evaluation of the proposed system. A 20-year life-time performance simulation is performed under three operation scenarios with different sizes of the PVT collectors. The results showed that the performance of the proposed system is highly dependent on the size of the PVT collectors. For the case building studied, it is more effective to use the heat gathered by the PVT collectors to produce DHW if the area of the PVT collectors is less than 54 m2. Otherwise, it is better to use the thermal energy generated from the PVT collectors to recharge the ground during the transient periods and to provide space heating during the heating period. Furthermore, an economic analysis is carried out to determine the optimum size of the PVT collectors for the case study building. The results from this study demonstrate how building simulation offers the capability in analyzing and determining the optimal operation strategies for complex energy systems at the design stage. © 2017 Building Simulation Conference Proceedings.

As a potential solution to this problem, we present a geothermal recycling system for mines (GRSM) for parallel mine cooling and surface heating.

Numerical simulations taking into account latent heat effects due to water-ice phase changes demonstrated that the 10-year performance of small-diameter borehole heat exchangers is as valuable as conventional diameters. Moreover, owing to the cold underground, deeper boreholes perform significantly better than shallow ones. A heat extraction rate of 35 W m-1 can be sustainably maintained by a 300-m borehole. The financial analysis showed that ground-source heat pumps are a viable alternative to fossil fuels. Absorption heat pump is the most interesting technology, but only district-scale applications could justify high drilling and installation costs of vertical ground heat exchangers.

	abstract = {Active demand response (ADR) is a powerful instrument among electric demand side management strategies to influence the customers' load shape. Assessing the real potential of ADR programmes in improving the performance of the electric power system is a complex task, due to the strict interaction between supply and demand for electricity, which requires integrated modelling tools. In this paper an analysis is performed aimed at evaluating the benefits of ADR programmes in terms of electricity consumption and operational costs, both from the final user's and the overall system's perspective. The demand side technologies considered are electric heating systems (i.e. heat pumps and electric resistance heaters) coupled with thermal energy storage (i.e. the thermal mass of the building envelope and the domestic hot water tank). In particular, the effect of the penetration rate of ADR programmes among consumers with electric heating systems is studied. Results clearly show that increasing the number of participating consumers increases the flexibility of the system and, therefore, reduces the overall operational costs. On the other hand, the benefit per individual participant decreases in the presence of more ADR-adherent consumers since a reduced effort from each consumer is needed. Total cost saving ranges at most between about 400 € and 200 € per participant per year for a 5% and 100% ADR penetration rate respectively. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {This article presents the characteristics and performance of an innovative dual source heat pump (DSHP) for heating, cooling and domestic hot water (DHW) production. The research work was carried out in the framework of the H2020 European project: Geot€ch 'GEOthermal Technology for economic Cooling and Heating'. The DSHP is able to choose themost favourable source/sink in such a way that it can work as an air-to-water heat pump using the air as a source/sink, or as a brine-to-water heat pump coupled to the ground. The DSHP is manufactured as an outdoor 'plug & play' unit, working with R32 refrigerant and including a variable speed compressor, which gives full capabilities for an efficient modulating operation. The DSHP was fully characterized in steady state conditions at the IUIIE laboratory. In order to assess its dynamic performance and to identify key control strategies to optimize its annual operation, a complete integrated model of the DSHP system in TRNSYS including the DSHP and all the other system components was developed. A first energy assessment, carried out for an office building located in the Netherlands, proves that the DSHP system would be able to reach a similar efficiency than a pure ground source heat pump (GSHP) system with half the ground source heat exchanger area needed. Therefore, the DSHP system could become a costeffective alternative solution for heating, cooling and DHW production in buildings, as the initial investment would be significantly reduced compared to GSHPs, with similar or even higher energy efficiency. © The Author(s) 2018.

	abstract = {This study developed an alternate operational control system for ground source heat pumps (GSHP), which was applied to determine combined space heating and domestic hot water (DHW) power equations at design temperature. A domestic GSHP with an alternate control system was implemented in a whole building simulation model following the heat deficiency for space heating based on degree minute counting. A simulated GSHP system with 200 L storage tank resulted in 13%-26% power reduction compared to the calculation of the same system with existing European standards, which required separate space heating and DHW power calculation. The periodic operation utilized the thermal mass of the building with the same effect in the case of light and heavy-weight building because of the very short cycle of 30 min. Room temperatures dropped during the DHW heating cycle but kept within comfort range. The developed equations predict the total power as a function of occupancy, peak and average DHW consumption with variations of 0%-2.2% compared to the simulated results. DHW heating added the total power in modern low energy buildings by 21%-41% and 13%-26% at design temperatures of -15 °C and -26 °C, respectively. Internal heat gains reduced the power so that the reduction effect compensated the effect of DHW heating in the case of a house occupied by three people. The equations could be used for power sizing of any heat pump types, which has alternate operation principle and hydronic heating system. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In the NW part of the Romania, there are geological conditions that allow to geothermal phenomena to manifest on the surface of the Earth. The limited exploitation of this energy resource is still limited by existing technologies and by the high cost of deep-water equipment. For a good image of the Romania's geothermal potential, we present, in our paper, the temperature map at 3000 m deep and the geothermal flow map on the surface. These maps were made with the Surfer program, based on the data obtained through digitalizing geothermal maps of Romania (scale 1: 1000000) using Surfer software, kriging method for interpolation. Also, we made maps with other geophysical parameters after smoothed and filtrated of data (Bouguer anomaly, Free Air anomaly, geoid). The Pannonian geothermal aquifer is multi-layered, confined and is located in the sandstones at the basement of the Upper Pannonian (late Neocene age), on an approximate area of 2,500 km2 along the western border of Romania, from Satu Mare in the north to Timisoara in the south. The aquifer is situated at the depth of 800 m to 2,400 m. It was investigated by more than 100 geothermal wells, all possible producers, out of which 33 are currently exploited. The thermal gradient is 45-55°C/km and the wellhead temperatures range are between 50°C and 85°C. In the area of Oradea, Baile Felix and 1 Mai, drillings have been made and geothermal waters have been exploited for therapeutic purposes for more than 100 years. Lately, systematic actions have been launched to prospect, explore, evaluate and exploit geothermal deposits. In all geological formations there are aquifers layers with very varied thermal capacities and properties, with surface thermal fluxes higher than other areas. The most important thermal aquifer system of the Pannonian Depression is the system based on the upper Pannonian, highlighted by surveys. The water in this system is generally eruptive due to the high dissolved gas content. Because of this, they can be used especially for therapeutic purposes and domestic hot water. © SGEM2019.},

	abstract = {Activating the thermal mass of a building by implementing Thermally Active building Systems (TABS) assists in reducing energy use for thermal management of buildings by utilising a low temperature heating and high temperature cooling approach. Coupling TABS with geothermal heat pumps that use low-grade energy source in addition to model-based predictive control (MPC) helps to further decrease energy use. Most equipment in hybrid GEOTABS buildings follow a modular structure that can be classified as low, medium and high temperature sources, and emission systems depending on the building type and needs. This work describes the main characteristics of the individual modules and interfaces of hybrid GEOTABS building and provides examples of three types of buildings that use the hybrid GEOTABS approach. These buildings are an elementary school in the Czech 'Republic, an elderly care home in Belgium, and an office building in Luxembourg. Although these buildings are functionally different, GEOTABS concept can be abstracted based on a detailed consideration of the interaction between energy transfer systems (e.g. geothermal heat exchangers, heat pumps, boilers) and emission systems (e.g. TABS, air handling units, radiators, domestic hot water). This work defines the generic concept, individual modules, and interfaces between related components of hybrid GEOTABS, enabling the specification of a design template with a "minimum" number of required operational parameters. Such a template can enable fast siting of major system components, consistency between design-build offers, and facilitate effective integration of the Hybrid GEOTABS into new buildings. © 2019 ASHRAE},

	abstract = {In this paper, energy and exergy analyses of a geothermal power based multi-generation energy production system which generates electricity, hydrogen, domestic hot water, heating and cooling are presented. The energy generated from geothermal resources can be used to drive an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) and a Quadruple Effect Absorption Cooling System (QEACS), and further used to produce hydrogen using by a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer. A part of produced electricity from the ORC can be used as the work input for the PEM electrolyzer, and waste heat of geothermal resource in the electrolyzer process can be used to preheat the inlet electrolyzer water. Multigeneration system analysis is conducted by using the Engineering Equation Solver (EES) software using methods based on energy, exergy and thermoeconomic analyses. Also energy and exergy efficiencies of four sub-systems which are a geothermal power plant, an ORC, an absorption cooling system and a PEM electrolyzer are calculated. In addition, a parametric study is given in order to find out how different operating conditions affect the whole-system performance and its sub-systems efficiencies. As a result, it is observed that overall energy and exergy efficiencies of whole system are 47.04% and 32.15%, respectively. Parametric study shows that while geothermal water temperature rises from 130 °C to 200 °C, electrical power generation of system increases from about 4 MW to 8.5 MW and hydrogen production rises from about 0.030 kgs−1to nearly 0.075 kgs−1.

The studied configurations include the cycle with (a) expansion valve (EVC), (b) with expander (EC), (c) with expansion valve and Internal Heat Exchanger (EVC + IHE), and (d) with expander and IHE (EC + IHE). The unit cost of heat ($/kWhex) for each configuration was determined under two scenarios of a) constant Space Heating (SH) and b) constant Domestic Hot Water (DHW) loads with the peak of 8 kW. The results showed that the lowest unit cost of heat (cq) and the highest total exergy efficiency (ηex) are associated with the (EVC + IHE) and (EC + IHE) configurations, respectively. Also, it was shown that for the SH (or DHW) load, 20% (or 14%) increase in the ηex results in 21.5% (or 20%) increase in the cq considering the electricity cost of 0.025 $/kWh. For the electricity cost of 0.25 $/kWh, however, 11% (or 20%) increase in ηex results in increasing the cq by about 7% (or 13%).

	abstract = {This article covers a comparative analysis of the potentials and constraints of different heat sources (air, geothermal boreholes, lake, river, groundwater and solar thermal) exploited by HP systems, implemented in various types of multifamily buildings (MFB) – new, retrofitted and non-retrofitted – which correspond to real case studies situated in Geneva. After characterizing the various heat sources and building demands, as well as presenting the numerical model and adopted sizing values, we study the intrinsic potential of the various HP heat sources and show that the HP seasonal performance factor (SPF) is directly correlated to the heat source temperature. In a further step we consider complementary PV production for the HP system, taking into account the available roof area and daily profile match. For buildings with a combined space heating and domestic hot water heat demand up to 80 kWh/m2, which correspond to current best case buildings (10% of the existing MFB stock in Geneva), combined HP & PV systems should lead to an annual purchased electricity inferior to 15 kWh/m2 (with a factor 2 between best and worst heat sources), with an associated daily peak load up to 150 Wh/m2/day. For a demand below 130 kWh/m2 (which is the case of 75% of the existing MFB stock of the Canton), the various combinations of HP & PV systems mainly result in a purchased electricity below 45 kWh/m2. The daily peak load reaches up to 500 Wh/m2/day, or eventually higher in the case of high-rise buildings. Aside from the final purchased electricity, the annual electricity injected into the grid is in the order of 15–20 kWh/m2 for low-rise buildings, and half that much for high-rise buildings (except for solar HP systems, for which the reduced available roof area for PV leads to significantly lower values). Lastly, SPF alone is not a sufficient indicator for the characterization of the HP system performance, since it doesn't reflect the absolute value of the electricity demand, which primarily depends on the building heat demand. Furthermore, both SPF and annual electricity demand are limited to annual balance considerations. As a complement, an indication of the peak electricity load gives valuable indications of the potential stress on the grid. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

In both regions the solar assisted GSHP system demonstrated energy savings over a conventional space heating system, while successfully overcoming an annual ground energy imbalance and reducing the required borefield size. From a grid perspective, although the HP systems shifted the space heating fuel source from fuel oil to electricity, the solar thermal system is able to help minimize the use of inefficient auxiliary heat to meet the space heating loads. The high associated capital costs of a GSHP system coupled with a solar thermal system make the economics difficult to justify; however for regions where energy security is of high importance, the energy savings achieved with these systems can have a substantial impact. © 2016 The Authors.},

	abstract = {District heating is widely used in heating buildings in Finland. Due to new European legislation, increasing adaption of renewables, and new stakeholders in the heating business, Finnish district heating needs to evolve. This paper analyzes energy and emissions impacts of different heating energy scenarios in a typical Finnish district heated area. A period of 20 years (2015–2035) was studied assuming the future development of the building stock. The conservative, extensive and extreme scenarios assumed different amounts of solar energy and ground source heat pumps to be implemented as decentralized systems. In addition, two heat prosumer scenarios were analyzed, namely an industrial waste heat scenario and a modest solar heat prosumer scenario. Despite the increase of the buildings’ total floor area by about a third, the combined heating and domestic hot water consumption per floor area was estimated to decrease by about 36%. The extreme scenario with ground source heat pumps and a solar thermal system decreased the annual centralized heat production by 34% and the industrial waste heat scenario by 32%. The waste heat scenario decreased the emissions the most. © 2017},

	abstract = {Spectral gamma ray (SGR) is a logging tool that allows computation of the radioactive heat produced through radioactive decay of uranium, thorium and potassium within rocks. Radioactive heat-producing rocks are common targets for geothermal exploration. Gamma rays have longer half-length life in comparison to other radiations generated during radioactive decay. This characteristic allows the gamma rays to permeate far enough through the media to be measured by a logging tool. Radioactive heat production in this study was computed using spectral gamma ray and density logs. High-temperature geothermal reservoirs could provide heat that could be used to produce electricity from steam turbines. To provide domestic hot water, space heating, or process hot water, both low- and high-temperature geothermal systems could be used. This article is a case study illustrating subsurface radioactive heat production (A) calculated using well log data recorded in 48 wells located at 16 counties in the South Kansas State, USA. The results show that radioactive heat production (A) varies from approximately 0.1 to more than 10 μW/m3, whereas the average arithmetic mean is 1.15 μW/m3 and the average standard deviation is 0.57 μW/m3, which varies with lithology. The high measurements of radioactive heat production (A) in the studied rocks are predominantly related to the respective increase in uranium content in both shale and carbonate formations that could be future geothermal targets. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

One of the methods that were used is the Ministry without Portfolio Decree No. 7/2006 for energy certification and MSZ-140-04 for energy demand calculations (by using WinWatt computer software) that are a widely used in the Hungarian practice by HVAC designers and experts. Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) is also more and more common used PC software in Hungary due to the continuously tightening energy requirements. To see the differences and imperfections between these methods the heating, cooling and ventilation system was designed of a given single family house and the annual energy consumption was investigated with these methods. To perform the investigation in more detailed three different heating systems were designed. In the first case the heat source is a condensing boiler operated with floor heating. In the other two cases the thermal systems are heat pumps with floor and ceiling heating. One of the heat pumps is an air-to-water system, the other one is a geothermal heat pump. The advantages of the heat pumps are that heating, cooling and domestic hot water energy is produced by only one equipment and efficiency. However comparing investment and operating costs for the heat pumps with gas boiler the payback time is very long based on this study. The investment costs, payback periods are investigated for the three different systems evaluating the results also with PHPP and WinWatt computer software tools in this study. © 2017 The Authors.},

A solar thermal system operating with various control strategies has been designed with an integrated ground source heat pump and a seasonal borehole storage to provide domestic hot water (DHW) and space heating (SH) for community-size demand. The system has two short term storage tanks, a hot tank and a warm tank. The impact of the considered system solutions on electricity consumption has been evaluated and compared as a function of the different collector control modes and different tank configurations (short term tanks sizes). Results have shown that the proposed system was able to provide a 78-83% renewable energy fraction. Total electricity consumption of the heating system varied by 20% between the best and the worst cases. Furthermore, system performance was better when solar energy was mainly stored in the warm tank. During a 5-year simulation, the annual seasonal storage efficiency improved from 0.23 to 0.31, whereas the heat pump electricity consumption reduced from 57.17 MWh to 45.93 MWh. The demand in winter was met mainly through ground heat and the rest was provided by the heat pump compressor. However, the demand in summer was met almost completely by solar energy. © 2016 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Effective storage and release of low-to-moderate temperature thermal energy (e.g., solar thermal or geothermal) could be transformational for applications such as space heating/cooling, domestic hot water, or off-grid cooking. Good candidates for thermal energy storage in this temperature range include latent heat storage (LHS) systems and thermochemical energy storage (TCES) systems using reversible salt-hydrate dehydration reactions. Here, we propose that an energy-storage system by use of magnesium nitrate hexahydrate can potentially improve upon independent TCES or LHS systems by utilizing both the thermochemical hydration reaction and the latent heat available through the solid–liquid phase change of one magnesium nitrate hydrate eutectic. This chemistry is investigated through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)/differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis and shows a total energy density of approximately 1170±94 kJ kg−1 when dehydrating the material up to 145 °C. Reversible latent heat cycling at a eutectic melting temperature of 130 °C is shown by the DSC signal and estimated to be on the order of 115±9.2 kJ kg−1—a 10 % increase over the thermochemical energy storage alone. Although the latent energy release was found to decrease slightly over several cycles, the mass was found to stabilize near an asymptotic value corresponding to the published eutectic composition. These results suggest the concept of reactive phase-change materials could be a promising solution to increasing the stored volumetric energy density. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

	abstract = {A dynamic simulation study in TRNSYS environment has been carried out to evaluate energy and economic performance of a novel heating and cooling system based on the coupling between a low or medium-enthalpy geothermal source and an Air Handling Unit, including a Desiccant Wheel. During summer season, a Downhole Heat Exchanger supplies heat to regenerate the desiccant material, while a certain amount of geothermal fluid is continuously extracted by the well in order to maintain high operating temperatures. Simultaneously, the extracted geothermal fluid drives an absorption chiller, producing chilled water to the cooling coil of the Air Handling Unit. Conversely, during the winter season, geothermal energy is used to cover a certain amount of the space heating demand. In both summer and winter operation modes, a geothermal energy is also used to supply Domestic Hot Water. A case study was analyzed, in which an existing low-enthalpy geothermal well (96°C), located in Ischia (an island close to Naples, Southern Italy), is used to drive the geothermal system. Results showed that the performance of the proposed system is significantly affected by the utilization factor of Domestic Hot Water. In fact, considering a range of variation of such parameter between 5% and 100%, Primary Energy Saving increase from 77% to 95% and Pay-Back Period decreases from 14 years to 1.2 years, respectively. The simulations proved the technical and economic viability of the proposed system. In fact, a comparison with similar systems available in literature pointed out that the layout proposed in this work is characterized by better energy and economic performance, especially in the best scenario. Finally, a sensitivity analysis showed that the system performance is mainly affected by the nominal geothermal flow rate and by natural gas cost. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC opens up a major opportunity for further use of heat pumps for heating and cooling of new and existing buildings. Heat pumps enable the use of ambient heat at useful temperature level need electricity or other energy form to function. Ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems use the ground as a heat source/sink to provide space heating and cooling as well as domestic hot.water. The GSHP technology can offer higher energy efficiency for air-conditioning compared to conventional airconditioning (A/C) systems because the underground environment provides higher temperature for heating and lower temperature for cooling and experiences less temperature fluctuation than ambient air temperature change. To date, the GSHP systems have been widely used in both residential and commercial buildings. It is estimated that the GSHP system installations have grown continuously on a global basis with the range from 10% to 30% annually in recent years. A ground-coupled heat pump (GCHP) system consists of a conventional heat pump coupled with a ground heat exchanger (GHE) where water or a water-antifreeze solution exchanges heat with the ground. The GHE may be a simple pipe system buried in the ground; it may also comprise a horizontal collector or, more commonly, borehole heat exchanger (BHE) drilled to a depth between 20 and 300 m with a diameter of 100-200 mm. A closed single or double U-tube is often inserted inside the borehole and a heat carrier fluid is circulated in the U-tube to exchange heat with the surroundings. For safety and stability reasons, a bentonite-cement suspension or an enhanced-cement is used to backfill the space between the U-tube and its surrounding soil or rock. The widespread distribution of heat pumps as single generators in heating systems has mainly been in new, rather isolated buildings, thus having limited unit loads. This has enabled the use of low-temperature terminal units, such as fan coil units and, especially, radiant systems. This chapter is focused on the energy and environmental analysis and modelling of a reversible GCHP. One of the main innovative contributions of this study is in the achievement and implementation of an energy-operational optimisation device for the GCHP system using quantitative adjustment with a buffer tank and a variable speed circulating pump. Experimental measurements are used to test the performance of the GCHP system at different operating modes. The main performance parameters (energy efficiency and CO2 emissions) are obtained for 1 month of operation using both classical and optimised adjustment of the GCHP system. A comparative analysis of these performances for both heating and cooling and domestic hot-water (DHW) with different operation modes is performed. Additionally, two simulation models of thermal energy consumption in heating/cooling and DHW operation were developed using Transient Systems Simulation (TRNSYS) software. The simulations obtained using TRNSYS software are analysed and compared to the experimental measurements.

Social efficiency means the difference of energy-environmental, economic or sociological effects connected with producing the same amount of usable product in conditions of applying reference fuel and renewable substitute energy source. The amount of useful product should equal the use of one substitute energy unit. The proposed method constitutes a generalization of the existing method of economic effect evaluation on the basis of the Economic Efficiency of Energy Substitution indicators (EEES). Furthermore, the relations of calculations which enable defining dimensionless indexes for the effects of interest and method of standardization of the social efficiency index were described.

	abstract = {A ground-coupled heat pump (GCHP) is a clean and energy-saving approach to providing air conditioning and domestic hot water. For buildings with a dominant heating load, more heat is extracted from the soil and thermal imbalance becomes a crucial problem, in turn reducing efficiency and impeding the wide application of GCHP. Due to the disadvantages of the existing solutions, a multi-mode air-source heat compensator (AHC) integrated with a GCHP system to make a hybrid AHC-GCHP system is proposed in this paper. The principles and operating strategy of AHC-GCHP are illustrated in detail and its performance is simulated in the transient system simulation tool TRNSYS. AHC can not only compensate heat into the ground but also supply heat for space heating and domestic hot water in different modes through full use of the energy in the air with the average coefficient of performance (COP) ranging from 4.49 to 15.09. The AHC-GCHP system effectively keeps the soil thermal balance, and saves 23.86% energy compared with a traditional "boiler + split air conditioner" system, and costs less than half as much as a "hybrid GCHP assisted with solar collector" system. Consequently, the AHC-GCHP system is a potentially efficient and economic approach for buildings in cold regions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

There are many studies proving the better performance of cascade heat pumps compared to single-stage heat pumps when the difference between the condensing and the evaporation temperature is large. In this system approach study, different GSHP arrangements are described and computationally compared. A two-stage heat pump arrangement is introduced in which water tanks of the heating system are utilized for warming up the DHW in two stages. It is shown that the electricity consumption with this two-stage system is approximately 31% less than with the single-stage heat pump and 12% less than with the cascade system. Further, both low temperature (LT) and HT heat pumps can run alone, which is not common in cascade or other two-stage heat pumps. This is advantageous because the high loads of the space heating and DHW production are not simultaneous. Proper insulation of the DHW and recirculation pipe network is essential, and drying towel rails or other heating coils should be avoided when aiming for a high efficiency. The refrigerants in the calculations are R407C for the LT heat pump and R134a for the HT heat pump. Investment costs are excluded from calculations. © 2015 by the authors.},

Accurate simulation tools are becoming important for the optimization of this technology. In this paper, a code for the hourly simulation of GCHP systems is presented, which allows the simulation of multifunction heat pumps for heating, cooling-dehumidifying and DHW production, considers the presence of storage tanks, and applies both to on–off and inverter-driven heat pumps. The energy needs of a residential building in Bologna (Italy) are selected as case study to analyze the effects on the system performance of unbalanced seasonal loads, of the total length of the borehole field and of the heat-pump inverter during a period of 80 years. The obtained results show that the long-term temperature decrease of the ground is small and does not cause relevant decrease of the seasonal COP or increase of the seasonal EER over the years. Increasing the total borehole length can yield an enhancement of the seasonal performance up to 20% for heating, 8% for cooling and 5% for DHW. Using an inverter-driven heat pump instead of an on–off one can improve the system efficiency up to 30% for heating, 40% for cooling and 10% for DHW. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {New municipal service buildings must be energy effective, and cost-optimality is one of the criteria for selecting the suitable energy performance improvement measures. A daycare building in a cold climate was studied by means of simulation-based, multi-objective optimisation. Using a genetic algorithm, both target energy use and life-cycle cost of the selected measures were minimised. It was found that extensive insulation of the building envelope is not a cost-optimal method to reduce the daycare building energy use. Improving energy efficiency of the ventilation system, utilising solar energy on-site and employing a light control strategy are preferable ways of improving the building energy performance. Ground-source heat pump is a more cost-optimal heating system for the daycare building than district heating. The cost-optimal sizing of the heat pump is small, only 28% of the required maximum heating power.

Thermal influence of these plants is however not still debated as it deserves and correct monitoring strategies appear to be of major importance both to better understand processes and to highlight their environmental effects into high populated areas. Litho-, hydro- and bio-sphere can indeed be adversely affected by temperature variations induced in the underground by heat storage applications. For this purpose, a geophysical monitoring approach using time-lapse electrical resistivity measurements contemporary to analogical simulations is here tested at laboratory scale. Results of the experiments are reported comparing measured apparent resistivity with direct temperature measurements and numerical simulations of heat propagation. Data presented confirmed that electrical resistivity has powerful relation with temperature variation in monitored media. In addition, they showed that also without performing data inversion valid temperature estimation can be carried out. Post-processing calibration of apparent resistivity data showed to be in acceptable agreement with both temperature measurements and numerical simulations. Simple apparent electrical resistivity variations appear therefore to be a promising, economic, quick and non-invasive tool for mapping thermal modifications induced in the underground by shallow geothermal applications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

The geothermal heat pumps are used, but with increased efficiency of air/water heat pumps, they become effective solutions. This work studies the efficiency of air/water heat pumps for residential buildings located in different climatic zones of Romania. Heat loss calculations were carried out for the selected buildings to ensure the correct heat pump was selected. The heat pumps provided a environmental friendly solution for the building indoor climatic requirements which were achieved by using state of the art technology.

The single-storey building is the final outcome of an Italian project - SMARTCASE - promoted under the umbrella of the European Regional Development Fund. The building has been designed for being a best practice of a new way of living, by reducing - as much as possible - energy needs, energy demand of active energy systems and by converting the entire request by means of on-site renewables. Starting from the architectural concept, and thus shape, geometry and organization of the functions, as well as by considering the thermo-physical peculiarities of the thermal envelope - built in coated X-lam in order to allow both thermal resistance and thermal capacity - the conception phase has interested many professionals. Analogously, all active energy systems, and thus the heating, ventilating and air-conditioning devices, equipment for domestic hot water, artificial lighting and plugged powers are the top of the technology. In addition, a great effort has been dedicated to monitoring and controls. Moreover, the solar energy systems, the air-cooled heat pumps, the geothermal boreholes allow to close to zero the energy balance. © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {A substantial part of the energy demand of residential buildings is due to fossil fuel powered space and domestic hot water heating. Reductions in the energy use of these buildings can be achieved by improving the thermal envelope, installing efficient building energy systems and improving user behavior. Alternatively, it may be possible to use hydro, solar, wind or geothermal to meet the energy demand. This paper presents a study of energy refurbishment measures and a direct geothermal powered district heating system for a neighborhood of existing residential buildings in Groningen, Netherlands. The study uses detailed thermal simulation models that rely on accurate building typologies and thermal characteristics, outdoor air infiltration data and occupant behavior profiles taken from an existing comprehensive survey of Dutch home user behavior. The predicted energy savings and costs show that both the geothermal and the energy refurbishment approaches are economically viable and result in large reductions in the environmental impact of space heating. Applying all refurbishment measures results in an 86% reduction in yearly gas consumption for heating with an investment payback time of fifteen years. The energy refurbishment approach has lower costs and lower financial risk while the geothermal grid has the lowest environmental impact. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Nowadays, heating power for buildings is often produced by on-site renewable energy sources. However, such sources typically cover only part of the energy demand of the building. Thus, electricity supply from the grid is necessary although it is usually the only necessary external energy source. Cost-effective utilization of electricity requires not only reduction in the share of electricity from the grid but also comprehensive control of all on-site energy systems. In this paper, such a control method is presented. The control procedure takes into consideration fluctuations in the price of electricity, environmental conditions, the thermal mass of the building, and energy storage. The study aims to reduce energy costs by flattening the electricity load's profile and switching the energy systems on and off at predetermined times according to a qualitative control procedure. Thermal and electricity loads are either forwarded or delayed in response to variations in the electricity price but maintain a comfortable indoor temperature. The control method is verified in a simulated residential building using weather data from Helsinki, Finland. The building includes a geothermal heat pump, a solar collector, and an electric heater as energy sources and a hot water tank for thermal storage. The main thermal loads consist of space heating and domestic hot water. The results of a full-year simulation are compared with those of a conventional method with no price-responsive features. The results indicate that load shifting is successful, especially during the cold season. The control method adapts correctly to large and abrupt scheduled loads. Although this method reduces electricity consumption by only 2%, the yearly cost of electricity is decreased by 11.6%. © 2018 Author(s).},

Oil heating is becoming more and more expensive, requires frequent tank refill operations, and has high emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutants such as SOx. In addition, spills from oil underground storage tanks (USTs) represent a serious environmental threat to soil and groundwater quality. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis on technical alternatives to oil heating with reference to the Aosta Valley (NW Italy), where this fuel is still often used and numerous UST spills have been reported in the last 20 years. We assess operational issues, GHG and pollutant emissions, and unit costs of the heat produced for several techniques: LPG boilers, wood boilers (logs, chips, pellets) and heat pumps (air-source, geothermal closed-loop and open-loop systems). We examine the investment to implement such solutions in two typical cases, a detached house and a block of flats, deriving payback times of about 3-8 years. Wood log boilers turn out to be the most economically convenient solutions; however, heat pumps provide several benefits from the operational and environmental points of view. In addition, including solar thermal panels for domestic hot water or a photovoltaic plant would have payback times of about 6-9 years. The results highlight the economic feasibility and the multiple benefits of a rapid phase-out of oil heating in Italy. © 2019 by the authors.},

However, experimental studies on GCHP systems are still insufficient. This paper first presents an energy-operational optimisation device for a GCHP system involving insertion of a buffer tank between the heat pump unit and fan coil units and consumer supply using quantitative adjustment with a variable speed circulating pump. Then, the experimental measurements are used to test the performance of the GCHP system in different operating modes. The main performance parameters (energy efficiency and CO2 emissions) are obtained for one month of operation using both classical and optimised adjustment of the GCHP system, and a comparative analysis of these performances is performed. In addition, using TRNSYS (Transient Systems Simulation) software, two simulation models of thermal energy consumption in heating, cooling and domestic hot-water operation are developed. Finally, the simulations obtained using TRNSYS are analysed and compared to experimental data, resulting in good agreement and thus the simulation models are validated. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {A ground-source heat pump (GSHP) system located in Chongqing, a cooling dominated region in China, was taken as an experimental system. In order to explore the operating characteristics of the GSHP system, the GSHP system was monitored with a data acquisition system. The measured data were analyzed, including the inlet/outlet water temperatures, power consumptions, EER/COP and also the ground temperature variations. The measured system EER of 2013 and 2014 are 3.01 and 2.91, respectively, while the system COP of 2013 is 2.59. A TRNSYS model was established based on the studied GSHP system. The accuracy of the model was validated by the comparison between the measured and the simulated outlet water temperatures, and also the ground temperatures. The model was then used to predict the long-term performance of the GSHP system. It has been found that after 20-years running of the system, the heat accumulation under the ground and the deterioration of system efficiency aggravate: the ground temperature would rise up to 30.5 °C from the initial value of 20 °C, while the ASPF value would descend to 2.72 from the initial value of 3.12. As a remedy for the problem, the domestic hot water (DHW) system was supposed to be operated in the following years, and the simulation showed that the operation of DHW system could effectively reduce the ground temperature and improve the system performance. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Domestic hot water is usually provided by domestic water heaters making use of electricity or natural gas, which are known for their great energy costs. These systems consume much energy and increase the total cost of required domestic energy. A novel system combining heat pump with water heater is proposed in this paper, and it is named domestic energy system. The system can realize the provision of space heating, cooling and domestic hot water throughout a year. Based on different types of air conditioners, space heating equipments and water heaters, domestic energy consumption patterns are concluded to be eight categories. This study describes and compares the eight domestic energy consumption patterns by economic analysis and prime energy analysis method. Results show that the domestic energy system can provide good economy and save energy significantly. Furthermore, exergy analysis method is employed to compare the exergy efficiencies of different energy consumption systems. The results show that the domestic energy system has the highest energy conversion efficiency and can make remarkable contribution to social energy saving. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Since the test bench emulates the building that is connected to the system being tested, the test can be carried out under "quasi"-realistic, dynamic conditions: dynamic weather conditions and occupancy profiles are used as well as a simulated building and heating/cooling system. This approach opens a large variety of possible test schedules since the simulated building, the heating system, weather conditions and occupancy can be changed freely. A methodology for the definition of a reference test scenario is analysed in this paper, for the case of a geothermal heat pump, allowing the application of the method to other systems, climates or buildings. The difference between real annual performance (in this study the annual simulation case) and performance obtained by reduced tests using this first approach is below 5 percent for four different climates and 4 different test sequences. The test result is the monthly and annual energy consumption and performance of the system split into SPF for heating, cooling and hot water production. A method has been developed that fits well for monthly and yearly energy figures for all modes. However, the errors of SPF values have not been reduced using this method. Therefore, the method is, at the date of publication, being updated to further improvement the approach.},

	abstract = {A new method was developed for the rapid and sensitive detection of viable Legionella pneumophila. The method combines specific immunofluorescence (IF) staining using monoclonal antibodies with a bacterial viability marker (ChemChrome V6 cellular esterase activity marker) by means of solid-phase cytometry (SPC). IF methods were applied to the detection and enumeration of both the total and viable L. pneumophila cells in water samples. The sensitivity of the IF methods coupled to SPC was 34 cells liter -1, and the reproducibility was good, with the coefficient of variation generally falling below 30%. IF methods were applied to the enumeration of total and viable L. pneumophila cells in 46 domestic hot water samples as well as in cooling tower water and natural water samples, such as thermal spring water and freshwater samples. Comparison with standard plate counts showed that (i) the total direct counts were always higher than the plate counts and (ii) the viable counts were higher than or close to the plate counts. With domestic hot waters, when the IF assay was combined with the viability test, SPC detected up to 3.4 X 10 3 viable but nonculturable L. pneumophila cells per liter. These direct IF methods could be a powerful tool for high-frequency monitoring of domestic hot waters or for investigating the occurrence of viable L. pneumophila in both man-made water systems and environmental water samples. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.},

	abstract = {Geothermal heat pumps (GSHPs), or direct expansion (DX) ground source heat pumps, are highly efficient renewable energy technology, which use the earth, groundwater or surface water as heat sources when operating in heating mode or as heat sink when operating in cooling mode. They are receiving an increasing interest because of their potential to reduce primary energy consumption and thus reduce emissions of the GHGs. The main concept of this technology is that it utilises the lower temperature of the ground, which approximately remains relatively stable throughout the year, to provide space heating, cooling and domestic hot water for buildings. The main goal of this study is to stimulate the uptake of the GSHPs. Recent attempts to stimulate alternative energy sources for heating and cooling of buildings has emphasised the utilisation of the ambient energy from ground source and other renewable energy sources. The purpose of this study, however, is to highlight the fact that use of the GSHPs as an environmental friendly technology able to provide efficient utilisation of energy in the buildings sector in an attempt to promote using of the GSHPs for heating and cooling. The paper presents experimental and theoretical results of the DX GSHPs carried out at the Department of Architecture and Built Environment in the University of Nottingham. The study highlights the potential energy cost saving that could be achieved through the use of ground energy sources. It also focuses on the optimisation and improvement of the operation conditions of the heat cycle and performance of the DX GSHP. It is concluded that the direct expansion of the GSHP, combined with the ground heat exchanger in foundation piles and the seasonal thermal energy storage could play a major role reducing building energy needs. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

	abstract = {Geothermal energy is becoming a more competitive energy than fossil fuels. A geothermal installation of water-to-water heat pump with low enthalpy was designed and monitored with temperature and pressure sensors, flow meters, and electric energy counters. A system was designed which allows the reproduction of the thermal conditions of the fluid that circulate through the inside of the drill pipes through a big water tank and an air-to-water heat pump. The heating and cooling operation of the geothermal heat pump were analyzed. The geothermal heat pump was not capable of maintaining a continuous production of heating when starting the domestic hot water consumption. This indicated that there is a higher previous use of heat in the desuperheater against the heating production in the condenser. The coefficient of performance was slightly higher in cooling mode than heating mode. The heating power was higher than the original BCG.

The optimization of the system design is carried out by the TRNSYS and a numerical simulation is performed for continuous operation of 20 years under the meteorological conditions of Beijing. Different control strategies are considered and the operational characteristics of each working mode are studied. The simulating results show that the long term yearly average space heating efficiency is improved by 26.3% compared to a traditional ground coupled heat pump (GCHP) system because the solar thermal collecting system is used to elevate the thermal energy in the soil and to provide direct space heating with heat storage. At the same time, the underground heat load imbalance problem for a heating load dominated GCHP is solved by soil recharging during non-heating periods, while extra solar energy is utilized to supply DHW. The flexibility and high efficiency of the SAGCHP system could offer an alternative for space heating and DHW supply by heat pump technology and solar energy in cold winters of northern China. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, the first variant also uses solar energy to heat the building thanks to a direct solar floor (DSF) and has a solar collector's surface more important. While taking into account the electric consumption of the circulation pumps, results show that the global electric consumptions of these two variants are identical and have a value equal to 31 kWh per square meter of building surface.

Geothermal or ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems provide heating, cooling as well as domestic hot water, by the use of the underground or bodies of surface water as heat source or sink. More specifically, a GSHP system comprises a heat pump (usually waterto- water) and a ground source system (ground heat exchanger or groundwater well) in order to provide heating and cooling to the building through a low-temperature heating system and domestic hot water as well. The main concept of a GSHP system is the maximization of the heat pump efficiency i.e. minimization of electricity consumption mostly due to underground temperature which is almost invariant throughout the year. So, it is clear that GSHP systems have contribution to the environmental protection and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. GSHPs are a mature industry, with a continuous trend of development and due to their increasing energy efficiency due to recent advances of the technology (described in the following chapters) are attractive and are more and more considered as an excellent substitute of conventional heating/cooling sources including air source heat pumps and variable refrigerant volume. Due to these advances in several cases the high efficiency of GSHP compared to the initial capital cost minimizes the need for subsidies. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {Field tests of solar thermal and heat pump systems have shown that the thermal behaviour and performance of the systems under real operating conditions depend on the control strategy and the interaction between the individual components. This is especially true for combined solar and heat pump systems which have available many distinguished modes of operation. As for this type of systems for domestic hot water preparation and space heating only few field test data from single installations are known, monitoring is being strengthened within the IEA SH&C Task 44 / HPP Annex 38 "Solar and Heat Pump Systems" in order to have a better basis for the assessment and comparison of the systems' performances. Two solar and heat pump systems have been presented. The first one disposes of a borehole heat exchanger while the second system includes an air to water split heat pump and an additional gas boiler. Both systems can also be differentiated by their target buildings: newly built single family houses in the first case and retrofitting of older buildings in the second case. The first installation has been monitored over a period of three years and showed good results. The solar regeneration of the geothermal probes ensures a high temperature level in the ground, so that the heat pump can be operated with a high system performance factor (SPF) in the long term. Result of the field test is an impressive confirmation of the high solar SPF of over 5 for the combined system, and of the stable ground source temperatures during several operating periods. The second system called hybrid solar and heat pump system due to the additional condensing gas boiler is one of seven systems to be monitored within the ITW project WPSol. Measuring equipment has been installed in the beginning of 2011 and measurements are ongoing. Reliable data are expected for 2012.},

	abstract = {In this study, a novel monovalent inverter-driven water-to-water heat pump with a desuperheater was developed. In this unique system, domestic hot water is produced at a constant temperature controlled by a variable flow rate and stored in a tank. The heat demand is constantly matched by the system through the use of an inverter-driven compressor, which eliminates the need for a buffer tank. Three heating configurations of the system were examined with respect to variable climate conditions and two space heating target temperatures: space heating (mode 1), domestic hot water production (mode 2) and a combination of both (mode 3). Mappings of the performance variables per frequency were constructed for mode 3. For the other modes, the highest COP was identified for each examined climate condition. The difference between modes 1 and 3 was less than 5% for every variable. The space heating target temperature had a strong influence on both modes, showing an average difference of 29% in the COP between 35 °C and 45 °C. Mode 2 exhibited a considerably reduced COP compared to the other modes, as well as the lowest refrigerant mass flow rate and highest compression ratio among the three modes. From the previous results and the examination of the compressor, the compression ratio presents itself as a key parameter that can help to increase the COP if maintained at low values. The results of this research could be applied to the design of a control methodology for monovalent heat pumps. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Due to passive solar design, cooling demand in residential buildings also needs an assessment and solution. Heat pump systems are a widespread solution to reduce energy use. A combination of heat pump and solar thermal collectors helps to meet standard requirements and increases the share of renewable energy use in total energy balance of country. The presented paper describes a simulation study of solar assisted heat pump systems carried out in TRNSYS. The purpose of this simulation was to investigate how the performance of a solar assisted heat pump combination varies in near zero energy building. Results of three systems were compared to autonomous (independent) systems simulated performance. Different solar assisted heat pump design solutions with serial and parallel solar thermal collector connections to the heat pump loop were modelled and a passive cooling possibility was assessed. Simulations were performed for three Baltic countries: Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.},

In this regard, geothermal energy and other renewable energy sources are becoming attractive solution for clean and sustainable energy future for Turkey. Turkey is the seventh richest country in the world in geothermal energy potential. The main uses of geothermal energy are space heating and domestic hot water supply, greenhouse heating, industrial processes, heat pumps and electricity generation. The district heating system applications started with large-scale, city-based geothermal district heating systems in Turkey, whereas the geothermal district heating centre and distribution networks have been designed according to the geothermal district heating system (GDHS) parameters. This constitutes an important advantage of GDHS investments in the country in terms of the technical and economical aspects. In Turkey, approximately 61,000 residences are currently heated by geothermal fluids. A total of 665 MWt is utilized for space heating of residential, public and private property, and 565,000 m2 of greenhouses. The proven geothermal heat capacity, according to data from existing geothermal wells and natural discharges, is 3132 MWt.

Geothermal energy is extensively used in the Rotorua-Taupo Volcanic Zone of the North Island, where hot water reservoirs underlie much of this region. A variety of techniques have been employed to extract geothermal heat which is cascaded for mulipurpose applications. These include generation of clean steam, refrigeration, space heating and cooling, domestic hot water and natural water for recreational and therapeutic uses. The central area of the city of Rotorua has geothermally heated buildings, including commercial buildings, hotels, schools, government centre and some industry. There are also other applications in forestry and horticulture. Where favourable combination of resource characteristics and use coexist, geothermal energy is very economical.

The GHP uses R407C as refrigerant and its main components are a scroll compressor, a thermostatic expansion valve, a plate heat exchanger as evaporator and a condensing section composed of two plate heat exchangers connected in series, operating as a desuperheater and a condenser. In the condensing section, water is heated at two temperature levels for the SH and DHW systems. The experimental results realize the high influence of the water temperature at the condensing section inlet on the GHP behaviour. The COP and the heating capacity decrease 48.7% and 5.6% by increasing the water temperature at the condenser inlet from 20 to 50 oC, respectively. The percentage of water flow rate diverted to the desuperheater for DHW production depends on the water temperature and flow rate at the condensing section inlet. However, the heat transfer rate at the desuperheater remains nearly constant regardless of the water flow rate at the condensing section inlet and the water flow rate driven through the desuperheater. The experimental results also show that the water temperature inlet at the condensing section determines the proportion of the heat transfer rate delivered at the desuperheater for DHW production and at the condenser for SH. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The Danish government plans to make the Danish energy system to be completely free of fossil fuels by 2050 and that by 2035 the energy supply for buildings and electricity should be entirely based on renewable energy sources. To become independent from fossil fuels, it is necessary to reduce the energy consumption of the existing building stock, increase energy efficiency, and convert the present heat supply from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. District heating is a sustainable way of providing space heating and domestic hot water to buildings in densely populated areas. This paper is a theoretical investigation of the district heating system in the Copenhagen area, in which heat conservation is related to the heat supply in buildings from an economic perspective. Supplying the existing building stock from low-temperature energy resources, e.g. geothermal heat, might lead to oversized heating plants that are too expensive to build in comparison with the potential energy savings in buildings. Long-term strategies for the existing building stock must ensure that costs are minimized and that investments in energy savings and new heating capacity are optimized and carried out at the right time. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

A heat supply system of a case city is used as a paradigm for Japan and a DHS is modelled according to standard practice for the same city, integrating geothermal heat and local waste sources. The local resources can supply 21% of the design load and natural gas is used for supplying the rest. For the analysis a pre-design exergy analysis tool combined with the specific exergy cost method is applied. The DHS and Japanese paradigm system have exergy efficiency of 4.2% and 5.4% respectively. Due to thermo-economic synergy effect however, the DHS has lower unit exergy cost of space heating and domestic hot water of 508$/GJ and 273$/GJ compared to 686$/GJ and 726$/GJ of the Japanese paradigm system. The DHS has considerable performance improvement potential through reduced operation temperatures and effective use of combustion sources through co-generation. The unit exergy cost difference leaves margin for capital investment cost increase for decreasing exergy consumption of the DHS. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The heat balance of the soil around the borehole heat exchanger and the characteristic of energy consumption for MFGSHP system were analyzed. The energy consumption and life cycle economic analysis for MFGSHP system were compared to the conventional system (i.e. air source heat pump and electric water heater). The results show that the heat balance can be obviously improved by applying MFGSHP system, and the increase in soil temperature is reduced by 3.9°C compared to the common GSHP system with the same borehole length. The energy consumption of MFGSHP in hot summer and cold winter zone is the highest in summer, moderate in winter and the least in spring and autumn. Compared with the conventional system, MFGSHP can reduce 46% of annual energy consumption, and the saving of present cost value is in the range of 7%-40% and payback period ranges from 5 to 12 a.},

The ATES and solar domestic hot water heating systems have been used since 1985. Instrumentation for ATES performance monitoring was installed during construction of the building, for research and verification of geothermal models. Energy monitoring, however, was implemented in 1991, to evaluate the energy consumed in operating various energy conserving systems. Initial data show coefficients of performance (COP) of about 4 to 5 for the ATES and heat pump systems respectively.},

A correct and effective design of a geoexchange system should not be performed without a precise and accurate knowledge of the subsoil variability and its related thermal properties. The present work shows a case study for the design of a field of borehole heat exchangers for climate control and domestic hot water production in a newly constructed residential area located in the municipality of Tarvisio (NW Italy). It is pointed out the fundamental importance of a correct geological prospection, based on the integration of direct and indirect surveys. Correct investigations were indeed crucial, coupled to a Thermal Response Test, for a proper identification of the thermodynamic characteristics of the subsoil and then for the optimization of the system. Specifically, this case study aims to serve as an example to highlight the importance of variability in the horizontal scale of the thermal conductivity of the subsoil and the potential errors that can be made if no investigation is undertaken. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

It is receiving increasing interest because of its potential to reduce primary energy consumption and thus reduce emissions of the GHGs. The main concept of this technology is that it utilises the lower temperature of the ground (approximately <32°C), which remains relatively stable throughout the year, to provide space heating, cooling and domestic hot water inside the building area. The main goal of this study is to stimulate the uptake of the GSHPs. Recent attempts to stimulate alternative energy sources for heating and cooling of buildings has emphasised the utilisation of the ambient energy from ground source and other renewable energy sources. The purpose of this study, however, is to examine the means of reduction of energy consumption in buildings, identify GSHPs as an environmental friendly technology able to provide efficient utilisation of energy in the buildings sector, promote using GSHPs applications as an optimum means of heating and cooling, and to present typical applications and recent advances of the DX GSHPs. The study highlighted the potential energy saving that could be achieved through the use of ground energy sources. It also focuses on the optimisation and improvement of the operation conditions of the heat cycle and performance of the DX GSHP. It is concluded that the direct expansion of the GSHP, combined with the ground heat exchanger in foundation piles and the seasonal thermal energy storage from solar thermal collectors, is extendable to more comprehensive applications. This chapter reviews some interactions between buildings and the environment. The correct assessment of climate helps to create buildings that have little impact to the external environment. The chapter also highlights how the correct design and use of buildings can help to improve the total environment.

The peak load in heating period is covered by a natural gas boiler and the electricity to drive the heat pump and for the lighting system of the "Solar House" is taken from the national grid. Energetic autonomy of the "Solar House" and the Nearly Zero Energy Status can be achieved if a significant part of the conventional energy currently used is replaced with nonconventional sources of energy from renewable sources. The analyzed solution for achieving this objective is a system for converting solar energy into electricity with strings of photovoltaic (PV) modules.

	abstract = {In this paper, a new hybrid system for improving the efficiency of geothermal district heating systems (GDHSs) is proposed. This hybrid system consists of biogas based electricity production and a water-to-water geothermal heat pump unit (GHPU), which uses the waste heat for both heating and domestic hot water purposes. Electricity generated by the biogas plant (BP) is utilized to drive the GDHS's pumps, BP systems and the heat pump units. Both the biogas reactor heating unit and the heat pump unit utilize the waste heat from the GDHS and use the system as a heat source. The feasibility of utilizing a hybrid system in order to increase the overall system (GDHS + BP + GHPU) efficiency is then investigated for possible efficiency improvements. The Edremit GDHS in Turkey, which is selected for investigation in this case study, reinjects 16.8 MW of thermal power into the river at a low temperature; namely at 40°C. Such a temperature is ideal for mesophilic bacterial growth in the digestion process during biogas production. 1.45 MW of biogas based electricity production potential is obtainable from the waste heat output of the Edremit GDHS. The average overall system efficiencies through the utilization of this kind of hybridized system approach are increased by 7.5% energetically and 13% for exergetically. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The simulation is capable of modeling and managing the different operation modes of the system such as combined space heating and domestic hot water, in order to provide realistic results, from which four control schemes based on two electricity tariff plans were developed. The schemes were tested on a subject low energy house for Tokyo and Sapporo, in Japan, for the coldest day of the year and for the heating season. Emphasis was given to the short-term domestic hot water storage. The results show that the application of the schemes with a flexible electricity tariff had lower cost over the scheme that used the flat rate pricing plan. Moreover, it was shown that no unique scheme was able to minimize the cost and electrical consumption for both locations. Additionally, a tradeoff between lowest cost and lowest energy consumption was identified for Sapporo. The results of this research could be applied to develop a more robust control on monovalent heat pump systems. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Remote communities must import energy to sustain life. Diesel powered generators are often used in small communities not connected to the electrical grid. Heat recovery from the generators can become the nucleus of a district geothermal energy system for a community. Other energy sources in the community can be integrated into a district geothermal system. These sources can include heat recovery from refrigeration plants in ice arenas or grocery stores, solar thermal, process heat, bio-mass boilers, etc. Waste energy is not always available when it's needed. A ground heat exchanger (GHX) can be used as a thermal storage medium for both short term energy storage (diurnal) as well as seasonal or longer term energy storage. The stored low-grade energy can be extracted as required using ground source heat pumps to provide space heating and domestic hot water. Working with the people in the community and with other stakeholders in the community, it is possible to develop an integrated district geothermal energy system to take advantage of waste energy sources in the community. Integrating waste energy sources into the system greatly reduces the size and cost of the GHX needed for such a system. This paper presents a potential scenario demonstrating how a diesel generator in a community could be integrated into a district geothermal energy system, using the community of Lac Brochet in Northern Manitoba, Canada, as a case study. © 2012 ASHRAE.},

Buildings with large intermittent and predictable peak heating, cooling loads or domestic hot water loads benefits the most from integration of TES devices by reducing peak loads to the ground heat exchanger (GHX).

Four alternatives are examined: i) a regular electric hot water tank; ii) the desuperheater of a ground-source heat pump with electric backup; iii) thermal solar collectors with electric backup; iv) a heat pump water heater (HPWH) indirectly coupled to a space conditioning ground-source heat pump. Energy simulations, using TRNSYS as the simulation engine, are performed to evaluate each alternative. The house simulated has 156 m2 of conditioned space and is located in a northern climate (Montréal, Canada). On site electrical production is accomplished using efficient photovoltaic (PV) modules generating 197.3 kWh/m2-year. Space conditioning is accomplished using an Energy Star 2.5 tons ground-source heat pump (GSHP). Results indicate that the alternative that uses thermal solar collectors is the best solution as it requires only 8.05 kW of peak PV power (compared to 8.75 kW for the next best solution). The total house energy requirements are around 11000 kWh. This amount of electricity has to be produced by the PV modules in order to achieve the ZNEH target.},

Three different GCHP efficiency levels were modeled, and the systems were modeled both with and without desuper-heaters to supplement domestic hot water tanks. The medium- and high-efficiency GCHPs were found to provide significant energy and demand savings in all four cities.},

	abstract = {Ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) provide an effective and clean way of heating buildings worldwide. They make use of renewable energy stored in the ground, providing one of the most energy-efficient ways of heating buildings. They are suitable for a wide variety of building types and are particularly appropriate for low environmental impact projects. They do not require hot rocks (geothermal energy) and can be installed in most of the world, using a borehole or shallow trenches or, less commonly, by extracting heat from a pond or lake. Heat collecting pipes in a closed loop, containing water (with a little antifreeze) are used to extract this stored energy, which can then be used to provide space heating and domestic hot water. In some applications, the pump can be reversed in summer to provide an element of cooling. The only energy used by the GSHP systems is electricity to power the pumps. Typically, a GSHP will deliver three or four times as much thermal energy (heat) as is used in electrical energy to drive the system. For a particularly environmental solution, green electricity can be purchased. The GSHP systems have been widely used in other parts of the world, including North America and Europe, for many years. Typically they cost more to install than conventional systems; however, they have very low maintenance costs and can be expected to provide reliable and environmentally friendly heating for in excess of 20 years. The GSHPs work best with heating systems, which are optimised to run at a lower water temperature than is commonly used in the UK boiler and radiator systems. As such, they make an ideal partner for underfloor heating systems. This article reviews seasonal thermal energy storage underground heat, and the potential of using heat pipe technology into the GSHP system. This research also covers soil thermal properties, estimated ground temperatures and methods of system control. It would appear to be a logical unit to rebate for a winter or summer peaking utility. The air heat pumps cannot match the lower cost of operating typical electric/gas equipment. The GSHP reduces demand and energy. Energy savings are sufficient enough to warrant added investments in the $600 to $900/ton range, especially if costs can be assumed in a 15 or 30-year mortgage. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

	abstract = {The amount of energy used for heating and domestic hot water (DHW) is very high and will keep increasing. The conventional ground source electrical heat pump used in heating-dominated buildings has the problems of thermal imbalance, decrease of soil temperature, and deterioration of heating performance. Ground source absorption heat pump (GSAHP) is advantageous in both imbalance reduction and primary energy efficiency (PEE) improvement; however, the imbalance is still unacceptable in the warmer parts of cold regions. A combined heating/cooling/DHW (HCD) system based on GSAHP is proposed to overcome this problem. The GSAHPs using generator absorber heat exchange (GAX) and single-effect (SE) cycles are simulated to obtain the performance under various working conditions. Different HCD systems in Beijing and Shenyang are simulated comparatively in TRNSYS, based on which the thermal imbalance, soil temperature, heat recovery, and energy efficiency are analyzed. Results show that GSAHP-GAX-HCD is suitable for Beijing and GSAHP-SE-HCD is suitable for Shenyang. The imbalance ratio can be reduced to -14.8% in Beijing and to 6.0% in Shenyang with an annual soil temperature variation of only 0.5. °C and 0.1. °C. Furthermore, about 20% and 15% of the total condensation/absorption heat is recovered to produce DHW, and the PEE can reach 1.516 in Beijing and 1.163 in Shenyang. The combined HCD systems can achieve a PEE improvement of 23.6% and 44.4% compared with the normal heating/cooling systems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The energy sector in Slovakia (Central Europe) depends significantly on the import of natural gas and other primary energy sources from abroad. This dependence can only be reduced by decreasing the energy consumption and by utilizing renewable energy sources. Geothermal energy is one of the most perspective renewable energy sources in Slovakia due to the favourable hydrogeological conditions. To exploit this energy, two geothermal boreholes were drilled in the city of Galanta in 1983 and 1984. The boreholes were selected to supply energy to the energy central, from which the heat for Galanta - North housing estate is provided. There are 1,236 apartments in the housing estate, for which it is necessary to cover the heating and domestic hot water demand. In addition to the apartments, heat supply is provided for a hospital, a retirement home and a primary school. The open geothermal energy system with indirect use of geothermal energy, constructed in Galanta, presents an energy supply solution that is unique for the region of Central Europe. Geothermal energy presents the dominant heat source and covers 89 % to 97 % of the energy demand, supplemented by a peak backup heat generator fuelled by natural gas. The low temperature excessive geothermal water that remains in the end of the process is used for heat pumps and for filling the recreational pools. Thereby, maximum utilization of renewable energy is achieved. The paper presents practical experience with design and operation of this unique system.},

In this paper we demonstrate a calculation method to obtain the amount of extractable heat from the earth in the function of time, mass flow and the spacing of U-tube legs. We constructed differential equations for the modelling of U-tube. In these equations the calculation of overall thermal resistance is complex. Much research has been done on this topic so far. In our paper we put forward a method to obtain overall thermal resistance in the function of time and the spacing of U-tube legs. Furthermore, we graphically show the change of the extractable temperature and the value of COP for boreholes with separate diameters. © 2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the integration of solar and geothermal energy in a novel polygeneration system producing simultaneously: electricity, thermal energy, cooling energy and fresh water. The polygeneration system under analysis includes concentrating photovoltaic/thermal solar collectors (CPVT), a Geothermal Well (GW) a multi-effect distillation (MED) system for seawater desalination, a single-stage LiBr-H2O absorption chiller and additional components, such as: storage tanks, heat exchangers and balance of plant devices. The CPVT produces simultaneously electrical energy and thermal energy, at a maximum temperature of about 100°C. The electrical energy is delivered to the grid, whereas the thermal energy can be used for different scopes. First, the thermal energy can be used for heating purposes and/or Domestic Hot Water production. As an alternative, solar thermal energy can be used to drive an absorption chiller, producing chilled water for space cooling. Finally, solar energy, in combination with the thermal energy produced by low-enthalpy (about 80°C) geothermal wells, may be used by the MED system to convert seawater into desalinated water. Geothermal energy is also used to produce Domestic Hot Water at 45°C. The system is dynamically simulated by means of a zero-dimensional transient simulation model. The simulation model also includes detailed control strategies, for the management of the different technologies included in such a complex system. The system is assumed to be operated in some of the several small volcanic islands in the Mediterranean Sea, assuming Pantelleria (Trapani, Italy) as main case study. Here, the availability of solar and geothermal energy is high whereas the availability of fresh water is scarce and its cost consequently high. Results show an excellent energetic performance of the system under investigation. From the economic point of view, the profitability of the system dramatically increases when user Domestic Hot Water demand is high. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {In Chinese market, many homes use heat pump systems for heating and cooling. Domestic hot water is usually provided by a domestic water heater making use of electricity, natural gas or solar energy, which is known for its great energy costs. These systems consume much energy and increase the total cost of the required domestic energy. A new system combining heat pump with water heater is proposed in this paper, and it is named domestic energy system. The system can realize the provision of space heating, cooling and domestic hot water throughout the year. Based on the different types of heat pumps and water heaters, domestic energy consumption patterns are divided into five categories: heat pump and gas-fired water heater system, heat pump and solar water heater system, heat pump and electricity water heater system, heat pump and heat pump water heater system, and domestic energy system. This study describes and compares all of the above-mentioned systems including energy and exergy analysis. Results showed that the domestic energy system can save energy and provide good economy.

Performance of the system was investigated and the effects of various design conditions were studied by Engineering Equation Solver (EES). The results show that the daily average electricity power efficiency is about 7.51% at the proposed system working conditions. Besides the power, the system can also produce much more heat, which can be used for further use, such as heat source of reboiler columns of carbon dioxide capture process using chemical absorption and space heating or domestic hot water preparation and so on. The daily average heat generation efficiency can reach up to 58.45%. It was also found that solar radiation has strongly influence on the cycle performance. Also the electricity power efficiency and heat generation efficiency decrease with increasing of the number of metal tubes of evacuated solar collector, but increase firstly and then decrease with the geothermal water temperature. Additionally, heat generation efficiency increases with increasing carbon dioxide flow rate, but electricity power efficiency increases first and then decreases with increasing carbon dioxide flow rate.

In the CHP system, the waste heat with mid-low temperature was directly used to generate domestic hot water or heat by the heat exchanger. Different from common methods, in this paper a new utilization approach of the waste heat with mid-low temperature by integrating the CHP system and the ground source heat pump (GSHP) was proposed, and a new coupling system was designed based on the integrating mechanism. Numerical simulations were implemented to investigate the performances of the proposed coupling system. The influence characteristics of the temperature of the warm water generated by the GSHP on system performances, including the coefficient of performance (COP) of the GSHP, the heat output and the total energy efficiency, were revealed. The results showed that with the same input and heat output, the proposed system can generate more power than the reference system, and the total energy efficiency and the COP of the GSHP were simultaneously improved. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper presents a comprehensive overview on the use of ammonia-based absorption chillers and heat pumps. The thermodynamic and physical properties of pure ammonia and binary and ternary ammonia mixtures are presented in correlation formulas. Developments and applications in subfreezing refrigeration, heating/domestic hot water, renewable energy utilization, waste heat recovery, thermal energy storage and miniaturization of absorption systems are presented and summarized. In subfreezing refrigeration, the evaporation temperatures for single-stage absorption lie mainly between -30 C and -5 C, and they can reach as low as -70 C in advanced absorption systems. Air-source and ground-source absorption heat pumps are suggested for heating/domestic hot water applications in cold regions. For renewable energy uses, ammonia-based solar absorption applications with various working fluids are quite popular, whereas geothermal and biomass energy systems are less studied. In thermal energy storage, ammonia-based working fluids are not advantageous for storage capacity or cycle efficiency, but they prevail for subfreezing energy storage. Additionally, ammonia-based fluids are also attractive options for the miniaturization of absorption systems due to the absence of crystallization. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The contribution of solar thermal systems in meeting the global energy demand is, differently to what it is often perceived, among the highest compared to traditional renewable energies (such as biomass and hydropower). It is slightly lower in terms of capacity (282.6 GWel) and energy produced (581.1 TWhel/y) than wind. Moreover, it is about double of the contribution of PV and about one order of magnitude larger than geothermal and CSP (concentrated solar power). The simplest and most widespread application of solar thermal systems is the production of domestic hot water (DHW). The solar heat can also be used for active heating and cooling of buildings, although the portion of the covered load is limited by the fact that the availability of solar radiation during the heating season is in general the lowest on an annual basis. Solar combi systems (for the combined production of DHW and heating) are widespread in some local markets (mainly European). Other solar thermal technology uses, less diffuse, with a high future application potential are: production of industrial process heat, solar district heating plants, solar cooling. The descriptions given of solar collectors in this section are also valid for these cases of application. However, these uses are beyond the scope of this text. More information about technological peculiarities and sizing criteria of the aforementioned systems can be found in the literature [1-4]. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.},

Geothermal energy for electricity generation has been produced commercially since 1913, and for 4 decades on the scale of hundreds of MW both for electricity generation and direct use. Utilization has increased rapidly during the last 3 decades. In 2000, geothermal resources were identified in over 80 countries, and there are quantified records of geothermal utilization in 58 countries in the world. The worldwide use of geothermal energy amounts to 49 TWh/y of electricity and 53 TWh/y for direct use. On the other hand, Turkey is one of the countries with significant potential in geothermal energy. Resource assessments have been made many times by the Mineral Research and Exploration Directorate (MTA) of Turkey. The main uses of geothermal energy are mostly moderate and low temperature applications such as space heating and domestic hot water supply, greenhouse heating, industrial processes, heat pumps, and electricity generation. The data accumulated since 1962 show that the estimated geothermal power and direct use potential are about 4500 MWe and 31500 MWt, respectively. Present applications have shown that geothermal energy in Turkey and other countries is clean and much cheaper compared to the other fossil and renewable energy sources.},

	abstract = {Heat can be collected from local energy sources and concentrated into a relatively small volume, and at a useful working temperature, by using a heat pump as the concentrator. That heat can be stored and utilized at a later date for applications like space heating. The process is doing two things at the same time: storing heat and shifting the power demand. The concentration step can be done at night when there is normally a surplus of power and its timing can be directly controlled by the power grid operator to ensure that the power consumption occurs only when adequate power is available. The sources of heat can be the summer air, the heat extracted from buildings by their cooling systems, natural heat from the ground or solar heat, all of which are free, abundant and readily accessible. Such systems can meet the thermal needs of buildings while at the same time stabilizing the grid power demand, thus reducing the need for using fossil-fuelled peaking power generators. The heat pump maintains the temperature of the periphery at the ambient ground temperature so very little energy is lost during storage. © 2014 by the authors.},

	abstract = {A district heating and hot water supply system is presented which synthetically utilizes geothermal energy, solar thermal energy and natural gas thermal energy. The multi-energy utilization system has been set at the new campus of Tianjin Polytechnic University (TPU). A couple of deep geothermal wells which are 2 300 m in depth were dug. Deep geothermal energy cascade utilization is achieved by two stages of plate heat exchangers (PHE) and two stages of water source heat pumps (WSHP). Shallow geothermal energy is used in assistant heating by two ground coupled heat pumps (GCHPs) with 580 vertical ground wells which are 120 m in depth. Solar thermal energy collected by vacuum tube arrays (VTAs) and geothermal energy are complementarily utilized to make domestic hot water. Superfluous solar energy can be stored in shallow soil for the GCHP utilization. The system can use fossil fuel thermal energy by two natural gas boilers (NGB) to assist in heating and making hot water. The heating energy efficiency was measured in the winter of 2010-2011. The coefficients of performance (COP) under different heating conditions are discussed. The performance of hot water production is tested in a local typical winter day and the solar thermal energy utilization factor is presented. The rusults show that the average system COP is 5.75 or 4.96 under different working conditions, and the typical solar energy utilization factor is 0.324. © Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

The purpose of the present work was to take one system at random, and study its performance characteristics in the context of the group, in order to explore the potential for predicting performance from a few readily obtainable parameters. The chosen system performed relatively well in summer and relatively poorly in winter (despite an average temperature lift for space-heating). This was found to be readily explicable in terms of domestic hot water set-point temperature, and compressor cycling behaviour. The latter may be affected by building fabric issues, or by user behaviour (e.g. window-opening). The study suggests that where sizeable groups of similar systems are installed in similar buildings (e.g. by social housing providers), an appropriate monitoring strategy may be to monitor a sample of installations in detail, and to predict the performance of the remainder based on limited but more easily obtained data. However, the limited dataset may need to include internal and ground-loop fluid temperatures, heat pump electricity consumption, and some detailed knowledge of building fabric and occupier practices. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Geothermal heat pumps (GSHPs), or direct expansion (DX) ground source heat pumps, are a highly efficient renewable energy technology, which uses the earth, groundwater or surface water as a heat source when operating in heating mode or as a heat sink when operating in a cooling mode. It is receiving increasing interest because of its potential to reduce primary energy consumption and thus reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases (GHGs). The main concept of this technology is that it utilises the lower temperature of the ground (approximately <32°C), which remains relatively stable throughout the year, to provide space heating, cooling and domestic hot water inside the building area. The main goal of this study is to stimulate the uptake of the GSHPs. Recent attempts to stimulate alternative energy sources for heating and cooling of buildings has emphasised the utilisation of the ambient energy from ground source and other renewable energy sources. The purpose of this study, however, is to examine the means of reduction of energy consumption in buildings, identify GSHPs as an environmental friendly technology able to provide efficient utilisation of energy in the buildings sector, promote using GSHPs applications as an optimum means of heating and cooling, and to present typical applications and recent advances of the DX GSHPs. The study highlighted the potential energy saving that could be achieved through the use of ground energy sources. It also focuses on the optimisation and improvement of the operation conditions of the heat cycle and performance of the DX GSHP. It is concluded that the direct expansion of the GSHP, combined with the ground heat exchanger in foundation piles and the seasonal thermal energy storage from solar thermal collectors, is extendable to more comprehensive applications. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The monitoring scheme used was designed to allow full characterization of the system, including monitoring of the heat supplied by the pump to both space-heating and domestic hot water, and also monitoring of the energy consumption of the various heat pump constituents. This approach is contrasted with a more commonly adopted approach where seasonal performance factors (SPF) are obtained without invading the heat pump enclosure. A number of issues are discussed which can lead to significant inconsistencies in the latter approach. Quantitative differences in the SPF obtained by the two methods are calculated or estimated for the monitored systems. Generally, the simpler approach leads to underestimation of the SPF by an amount which is variable and dependent on factors such as domestic hot water usage, pump settings and precise meter locations. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

Main changes have been the introduction of a new heat exchanger in the cooling circuit between the gas and liquid phases of the R407C coolant besides a bigger thermostatic expansion valves. Between the project results have been analyzed the trials over the commercial heat pump, the pattern of behavior of this equipment and the realized improvements on this model. The implementation of efficiency improvements in the new prototype and the carrying out of tests has allowed to obtain better results of his coefficients of performance and to assess the optimization of the new prototype.

	abstract = {A hot-water heating system using geothermal water, put into operation in 1700 dwellings in Paris, France, in 1976, is described. The original system consumed oil at 3400 tonnes/yr. Using geothermal water at 63C to provide under-floor heating (nominally at 55C), it is estimated that only 650 tonnes/yr of supplemental oil will be required to furnish 60,000 m**3 of domestic hot water at 55 to 60C. Geothermal energy is thus expected to provide 80% of the annual energy requirement. The wells from which the geothermal water is obtained lie at a depth between 1600 and 1800 m, and contain briny water at 60 to 75C. Water extracted from these wells must be reinjected to protect the environment. Therefore two pipes are required, one to extract the water and pass it through heat exchangers, the other to reinject the water after it leaves the exchangers. One exchanger serves the heating-system water, the other the domestic-water system. The pipelines are fiber-glass lined because of the corrosive geothermal water; for the same reason, titanium is used in the heat exchangers. To separate the extraction and reinjection lines, they are deviated below the surface.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY: To improve the economic performance of an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) plant and oilfields in the high water cut period, petroleum-associated water was used as the heat source. Based on this idea, a novel system consisting of six subsystems was proposed. Because of a low heat demand for oil gathering and transportation (OGT) in summer, excess heat was used to drive absorption chillers (ACs), the auxiliary cold source for the ORC in summer. Numerical calculations were performed to evaluate system performances. Results indicate that R601a is preferable. The AC can either serve buildings for air conditioning or further reduce the condensing temperature, and no original geothermal water bypassing is advisable for the AC. OGT can save about 6800 tons of oil, and heating systems can serve more than 258000m2 of buildings for heating in winter and over 47300 people for domestic hot water supply in summer. More importantly, up to 32000 tons of oil can also be recovered each year. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the status of geothermal development in Turkey as of the end of 1999. Turkey is one of the countries with significant potential in geothermal energy. Resource assessments have been made many times by the Mineral Research and Exploration Directorate (MTA) of Turkey. The main uses of geothermal energy are mostly moderate- and low-temperature applications such as space heating and domestic hot water supply, greenhouse heating, swimming and balneology, industrial processes, heat pumps and electricity generation. The data accumulated since 1962 show that the estimated geothermal power and direct use potential are about 4500 MWe and 31 500 MWt, respectively. The direct use capacity in thermal applications is in total 640 MW1 representing only 2 per cent of its total potential. Since 1990, space heating and greenhouse developments have exhibited a significant progress. The total area of greenhouses heated by geothermal energy reached up to about 31 ha with a heating capacity of 69.61 MWt. A geothermal power plant with a capacity of 20.4 MWe and a CO2 factory with a capacity 40 000 ton yr-1 have been operated in the Denizli-Kizildere field since 1984 and 1986, respectively. Ground source heat pumps have been used in residential buildings for heating and cooling for approximately 2 years. Present applications have shown that geothermal energy in Turkey is clean and much cheaper compared to the other energy sources like fossil fuels and therefore is a promising alternative. As the projects are recognized by the public, the progress will continue. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Ground source heat pumps show great promise as a means to substantially reduce house energy consumption. Through the use of the soil between 6 and 600 feet below the surface of the earth as the thermal energy source or sink, it is possible to obtain design coefficients of performance for heating and cooling in the range of 4 to 6. Furthermore, generation of domestic hot water is a substantial source of energy consumption in a house. As energy for space heating and cooling decreases, reducing energy for hot water generation becomes the next target. The use of a desuperheater for generating domestic hot water is a potential strategy to reduce this energy consumption by using the heat pump from the space conditioning system to create hot water instead of electric resistance or fossil fuel. However, before widespread implementation can be recommended, it is necessary to understand the magnitude of the impact of the elements that affect the thermal energy output of the desuperheater, such as heat pump runtime. Two unoccupied houses in Pine Mountain, Georgia, were instrumented to document the installed operational space conditioning and water heating efficiency of their ground source heat pump systems. The monitoring period began in January 2010 and continued through April 2011. During this period, interior thermostat setpoints have been maintained at constant values for heating and cooling, and scheduled hot water consumption occurred according to the occupancy profile schedule used in the U.S. Department of Energy's Building America Program. This paper will discuss the instrumentation methods and field operation characteristics of the two ground source heat pumps, including a comparison to the manufacturers' listed values of the coefficient of performance calculated from field measured data for the two ground source heat pumps. The measured efficiency of the desuperheater assisted domestic water heating system will be compared to other market available domestic hot water systems. © 2012 ASHRAE.},

	abstract = {Energy produced at the power plant has losses until it reaches the end-use site. Approximately two thirds of source energy is lost on the way. These are thermal losses at the power plant and losses in transmission and distribution systems. Energy prices are constantly rising. Energy security is another major issue for industry. All these aspects force industries to produce their own energy onsite. The use of mainframe gas turbines for power generation has increased in recent years and is likely to continue to increase. The proportion of power generation using combined heat and power is also growing mainly because of efficiency improvements and environmental benefits. Mini- and microturbines offer a number of potential advantages compared to other technologies for small-scale power generation, particularly for distributed power generation, although there are some technical and non-technical barriers to the implementation of the technology. Small turbines could be used for power generation in the industrial, commercial and residential sectors. The best common use of source energy is the production of combined heat and power (CHP). To optimize return on investment, systems are sized to have maximum utilization and minimum idle time. A detailed study considering the electrical and thermal energy needs of a hotel building located in Istanbul was carried out. Thermal and electrical peak loads of the building were measured and recorded. The peak electricity demand of the building was found to be 694 kW. Domestic hot water (DHW) and heating loads are 487 kW. Seven micro turbines of 65 kW (nominal electric power) are required to meet all the thermal energy needs of the building. The electricity generated by the microturbines is to be used to reduce electricity demand of the building. The analysis showed that 100% of thermal load and, 55% of electrical load is met with the selected capacity. Investment and operational costs are taken into account in calculating the feasibility of the project. In this study the net present value method is used for detailed life cycle cost economic analysis.as one of the sites selected for the program. Energy independence was defined as being “capable of acquiring or producing renewable energy equivalent to…consumption.” Wisconsin Public Power Incorporated contracted with the Energy Center of Wisconsin to identify and analyze the options for UW River Falls to achieve energy independence. Given the varied approaches and potential combinations of strategies and technologies for reaching the goal of energy independence, it was necessary to narrow them down to a manageable few. The narrowing process involved calculating the degree of “independence” produced by each measure and the resulting life cycle cost of implementing it. Energy independence was measured as the percent of carbon-dioxide (CO2) reduction from the energy consumption baseline. The final result shows the net present value cost (or savings) of various paths to achieving energy independence. The Energy Center evaluated four scenarios to energy independence for UW River Falls. For each scenario we evaluated a combination of measures, ranging from building efficiency and conservation to biomass-fueled boiler plants. The four scenarios are: • Standard Scenario: attempts to make full use of existing campus infrastructure with as little capital investment as possible; • Geothermal Scenario: implements a campus-wide geothermal heat pump system to meet cooling and heating needs, produces an all electric campus; • Cogeneration—Follow Thermal Load Scenario: produces steam using biomass fuel to meet heating and cooling demand, with electric production secondary; and • Cogeneration—Follow Electric Load Scenario: produces steam using biomass fuel to meet all electric demand, with thermal needs secondary. The key findings are: • Energy independence can be achieved for as little as $19.1 million net present value over the existing baseline, or roughly $10 per gross square foot in today's dollars. • Achieving partial independence costs much less. For example, 64% independence can be achieved at one-tenth of the 100% cost. Costs rise dramatically after this threshold. • Life cycle costs are highly dependent on energy cost escalation assumptions. Under a high escalation scenario, energy independence actually saves money over the life cycle. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Four wells have been drilled for production and injection of geothermal fluids. Two wells, WE-1 and WE-2 are the geothermal supply wells. Well WE-3 serves as the primary injection well. Geothermal fluid at a temperature near 200°F (190-205°F) is pumped from production well WE-2. The 40 HP turbine pump supplies the pressure to force the geothermal fluid through the flat-plate heat exchangers and down the injection well. Customers currently pay 75% of the price of natural gas for space and hot water heating. A comparison of homes heated with natural gas and homes heated with geothermal energy show a savings between 17 and 22 percent for homes heated with geothermal energy.},

	abstract = {In this study, firstly, referring the calculated load, firstly, solar energy (SE) and vertical ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems covering space heating and domestic hot water, have been studied separately. Secondly, a hybrid system which is combination of SE and vertical GSHP systems have been investigated in optimum conditions. In the first option, vertical GSHP system can supply both space heating and domestic hot water requirements with a heat pump, which has 26.2 kW capacity. As a second option, it is determined that, with 20 collectors (as villa's roof area allows) SE system can supply 28% of total space heating and domestic hot water requirements. In this option the capacity of heat pump decrease to 16,87 kW. This system which consists of SE and vertical GSHP will be called 'hybrid system' in this paper. For each option, parameters of heat pump have been indicated with tables. With another choice, if SE will be used for domestic hot water only, 68% of domestic hot water during average of the year is possible with 2 collectors. Because of natural gas and LPG are preferred to be used in Istanbul as a conventional system in heating, the heating cost of the villa with natural gas and LPG also calculated and compared with the hybrid system. Hybrid system and natural gas is closer due to the operating cost and LPG more expensive. However due to investment cost, natural gas is the cheapest and hybrid system is the most expensive one. On the other side, government does not supply investment encouragements. Levelized annual total costs for conventional natural gas system, hybrid system and the LPG system are respectively, 0.037 €/kWh, 0.075 €/kWh, 0.076 €/kWh.},

The purpose was to show the potential of heat pump technology in order to raise the acceptance of the technology, and to show that heat pumps are energy-efficient in cold climates. Another goal was to learn more about how SPF is influenced by different system designs. Parts of this study are the Swedish contribution to IEA HPP Annex 37 "Demonstration of field measurements of heat pump systems in buildings". The study covered two buildings with geothermal heating, one with geothermal heating combined with solar panels, one brine/water heat pump connected to ground storage combined with solar panels, and one building with an air/water heat pump combined with solar panels. The parameters monitored in the project were temperature and volume flow of heat carriers and tap water, and electrical energy used by compressors and circulation pumps. SPF, energy coverage ratio, energy savings and CO2 reduction were calculated. The results show that there is a potential for energy savings and CO2 reduction by using heat pump technology. Energy savings up to 75 % of the supplied heat have been demonstrated. CO2 reductions are influenced by which type of heating system the heat pump system is compared to, and how the electrical energy is produced. When reporting results from field measurements, it is important to state which electrical components that are included in the analyses. This study used the system boundaries defined in the European SEPEMO-build project. SPF for the five installations ranged from 2.8 to 4.0 when all electrical equipment was included in the calculations, which implies that heat pumps are energy-efficient in cold climates. The SPF value is not the only performance indicator to consider when evaluating heat pump systems. Also energy demand, energy coverage ratio, CO2 emissions, availability are most important parameters for heating systems in which a heat pump is combined with other heat sources, and for systems with large proportion of domestic hot water production. © 2012 ASHRAE.},

A detailed steady-state simulation model for the HGCHP system has been developed based on the basic conservation laws of mass and energy and heat transfer correlations. As compared with the cooling-only scheme without DHW heating, the HGCHP system with DHW provision can achieve considerable energy savings and greatly alleviate the heat buildup in the ground through using excess heat for preheating or producing DHW.
