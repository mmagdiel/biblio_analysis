	abstract = {Wind is an environmentally friendly energy source that can be harnessed as an on-shore and off-shore resource. Wind energy, combined with other renewable energy systems, has resulted in a more reliable, feasible, and efficient stand-alone system, known as a hybrid renewable energy system, in which excess energy is stored in batteries. To make hybrid renewable energy systems more efficient using economical energy storage, even in off-grid mode, various other energy combinations have been implemented. In analysing the various combinations of hybrid renewable energy systems, economic factors, such as fuel cost, cost of energy, net present cost, and capital cost, as well as technical factors, namely duty factor, excess energy, average energy production, and unmet load, are considered. The consideration of both economic and technical factors provides comprehensive guidance in determining the optimum load combination, storage type and capacity, off-grid and on-grid simulation details, energy balancing, scale of optimum production, risk assessments, and investor confidence. Accordingly, the operation of hybrid renewable energy systems has improved and become more reliable. Furthermore, the improvement of hybrid renewable energy system performance owing to techno-economic assessments has significantly reduced the costs of battery energy storage used in hybrid renewable energy systems as a backup system. In addition, such improvements in hybrid renewable energy system operation have enabled enhanced applications of these systems in the off-grid mode and resulted in the reduction of high grid upgrading and extension costs in various locations. Hybrid renewable energy systems facilitate the economical distribution of distributed electricity generation in various isolated areas with low density. The analytical methods described in the literature cover various aspects and factors considered in the techno-economic assessments of hybrid renewable energy systems in several countries. This study reviews the penetration of wind power into hybrid renewable energy systems as a solution to current energy deficiencies in different countries around the world. The review is conducted based on the available technical and economic factors of different countries to analyse the wind power penetration in various hybrid systems. Asian countries are noted to have the potential to penetrate wind energy into hybrid systems, yet some constraints, such as lack of experience and information, are a major limitation. Furthermore, in European countries, curtailment, high -wake effects, and financial difficulties are common. The technical development of wind power is insufficient in African countries. European countries are ahead in terms of the technical development of wind power penetration into hybrid systems. In some developed countries, such as Germany, hydrogen is used for energy storage, while batteries and generators are used in most Asian countries. In European, Asian, and North and South American countries, the solar/wind combination was identified as economical whereas photovoltaic and diesel/wind were in African countries. Despite these challenges, almost all countries have identified the potential for wind power generation using the available wind energy resources. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Universal access to electricity in isolated areas is a social imperative and a substantial challenge for service providers. One such area is the Pantanal, which is one of the world’s largest wetlands and located in the central-west region of Brazil. The energy supply to this region is complex not only due to technical aspects but also, and primarily, because of environmental issues such as large areas under environmental preservation and seasonal flooding. To incorporate environmental feasibility into decision-making for the electricity supply to remote areas, a survey of the environmental aspects of several supply alternatives was performed. Solar, wind and fossil-fuel power generation sources and the expansion of the conventional power grid were considered. Using multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), these alternatives were scaled, scored and weighted to develop socioenvironmental indices, which express the socioenvironmental impact of the supply alternatives in the affected areas. The results, presented in the form of georeferenced maps, are essential for identifying and measuring the existence and scope of impact of the supply alternatives and represent an important support source for decision-makers. © 2019, © 2019 IAIA.},

The most prevalent contaminants in water are arsenic, pathogens, organic compounds, metals, etc. Iron concentrations in some regions of Bangladesh exceed the WHO limit of 0.3 mg/L, with median levels above 2.0 mg/L. Approximately 67% of the population of Bangladesh drinks contaminated water. Chemically contaminated drinking water has severe health repercussions. This paper has outlined an automated water treatment system facilitated with auto dosing and auto filter cleaning system. The entire procedure is managed by programmable logic controller (PLC). With a SCADA (Supervisory control and data acquisition) system, the pump and many parameters may be monitored and controlled through the internet. We have also estimated required numbers of solar panels based on accurate load calculation to ensure our designed plant can be powered by solar energy.

	abstract = {It is still a challenging task to fulfill power demand of Tumba Hamlet in Tamaila Utara Village, which is an isolated area in the buffer zone of Nantu Boliyohuto Wildlife Reserve. The efforts to fulfill the demand had been carried out by the local government by distributing the Solar Home System (SHS) to all households in 2013. However, the SHS performance quickly declined because the solar panels in the rooftop covered by dense and lush trees, and then it did not work at all in 2018. This research performs pre-feasibility in building the micro-hydro powerplant (MHPP) and its sustainability potential in Tumba Hamlet to fulfill the community's electrical energy needs without disrupting the Nantu Boliyohuto Wildlife Reserve. A basic survey was performed in exploring river resources and topographical conditions in this hamlet. Sustainability study, including technical, social, and environmental aspects, was conducted by interviewing the residents. The results show that the power needs in Tumba Hamlet are 48.5 kW. This demand can be fulfilled by the MHPP with head and water discharge of 10 meters and 0.706 m3/s, respectively. It was found that positive feedback in the technical, social, and environmental aspects of sustainability is dominant. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Intensive farming causes an important amount of greenhouse gas emissions. This scenario can be significantly reduced by the implementation of renewable technologies and transforming farms from energy consumers to energy providers. In the particular case of livestock production, biogas and solar energy reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the energy demand of the installations. However, the implementation of these technologies requires solutions adapted to local scenarios, such as connectivity to the energy grids. In this work, a biogas/biomethane production system, energetically covered with hybrid solar panels is proposed as a solution for isolated areas where biodegradable substrates (manure) are abundant. Thus, the electrical and thermal requirements of the digester are supplied by solar panels, reducing the biogas self-consumption and the energy inputs from the electrical grid. Hybrid solar panels also provide sufficient energy for operation of an upgrading system to obtain biomethane of fuel vehicle quality, increasing the energy self-sufficiency of the agricultural activities. This solution has been simulated in five different climatic regions corresponding to areas of intense pig farming activity. The results demonstrate the sustainable bioenergy production in isolated farms with limited connection to the energy grid and organic matter availability. Furthermore, the economic study showed that the proposed technology is competitive compared to other technologies in the energy sector. © 2023},

Researching best-fit implementations of battery sizing is vital in providing electrification to isolated areas. MATLAB was utilized to determine the battery sizing in a photovoltaic-battery DC off-grid system using a lithiumion degradation model. The system was subjected to various battery and solar array sizes to determine the relationship between sizing and lifetime. Results indicate that the minimum battery size of 22 is appropriate for the system based on the load and solar output to which no blackouts occur with a minimum expected lifetime of 114, 675 hours, or 13.08 years. Furthermore, the correlation between photovoltaics and BESS sizes was observed to ensure maximum battery life and minimal blackouts in off-grid systems.

Related research is focused on the implementation of such production systems without paying the necessary attention to the identification of the proper location for the installation of such a system. This chapter attempts to examine whether electricity production systems, based on renewables (PV, wind), in small villages worldwide are sustainable. A multi-criteria methodology for identifying the most appropriate location(s) for installing low-scale RES-based hybrid electricity production systems to cover local energy demands without grid connection is presented here. The selection is initially based on geographical, spatial, and demographical data; also taken into account are optimally combined meteorological data (solar and wind potential), with available resources (in terms of free space and investment costs) and the desired loads.. On top of that, optimization in not only size and operation of the hybrid system, but also in the composition of energy sources mixture, is also performed. Finally, the use of LCA helps to reduce the environmental cost and thus to improve the total sustainability of the applications. In conclusion, this chapter could serve as a policy tool for promoting and generating off-grid electricity at national level, but also as an assessment of autonomous energy production from renewable energy systems for small off-grid settlements, which is deemed viable based on the presented methodology. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Energy is a key factor in the global economy, and therefore modeling of energy systems has received significant research attention. Energy system models are the mathematical models, which are built to represent various problems, related to energy as accurately as possible. Most of the world’s energy generation is from fossil fuel, resulting in a continuous depletion of this resource. Production of milk, fruit, and vegetable along with their processing spread over 70% of the population in countries like India. Agricultural produce loses its value in remote areas due to the inadequate preservation facilities available during its storage and transit. At a local village level, this spoilage could be avoided by supplying short-term cooling systems. Since the availability of feedstock and conversion processes are adequate, serious research has to be carried out to ensure a constant flow of energy services by introducing renewable energy-based technologies. In this chapter, a model is proposed for the technoeconomic assessment of a chilling device powered by hybrid renewable energy to satisfy the cooling needs in isolated areas where there is plenty of bioenergy and solar energy resources available. There is no appropriate research available for hybrid energy systems, with the mixture of existing renewable energy resources as reported in this work. To implement renewable energy for a chilling system, a comprehensive study is also required to find a suitable combination of different renewable energy sources to satisfy the cooling requirements in any remote region. The study conducted in the selected regions shows that the recommended milk chilling system with hybrid renewable energy could work with an overall system performance of 0.17-0.195 and a low payback period of 4.6-5.4 years, besides a positive net present value. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Various risk indicators of SHS, Solar-Diesel Hybrid Mini-grid, Biogas Plant and Wind Turbine are analysed and then ranked. An integrated Best Worst Method (BWM) and weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) method is proposed to select the best renewable energy technology based on risk indicators. At first, nine (9) risk indicators were selected based on literature review and experts' opinion. Then, BWM was deployed to find the weights of the risk indicators. Finally, a Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method, named WASPAS, was applied to select the optimum renewable energy technology for the study area. The results revealed that the SHS is the best technology. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to check the consistency of the rank order.

	abstract = {Hybrid power systems (HPS) based on photovoltaic (PV), diesel generators (DG), and energy storage systems (ESS) are widely used solutions for the energy supply of off-grid or isolated areas. The main hybridizing challenges are reliability, investment and operating costs, and carbon emissions problems. Since HPS are usually sized to provide energy continuously, it is essential to use the solar energy potential close to full capacity, especially on cloudy days. One of the prominent solutions to overcome these challenges is integrating solar tracking systems (STS). This article focuses on the optimal sizing of HPS based on PV-DG-ESS utilizing STS by analyzing technical, economic, and environmental aspects. Optimization is performed with the MILP solved via Gurobi, considering the net present cost (NPC) and loss of power supply probability (LPSP) objectives. The results indicate that horizontal and dual solar trackers can provide up to 50% better energy harvest performance and reduce NPC by up to 7%. It is also found that there is no significant difference in cost reduction between both systems. Moreover, STS is feasible if the cost is less than 375 USD and 250 USD for Sudan and South Sudan, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

The operation and role of the parameters that can influence the value of the rotation speed of the drive system are analyzed through a simulation, maintaining a constant speed in the case of the prototype is achieved through the control system because in real situations the temperature of heat sources can vary within certain limits.

	abstract = {The Indonesian government program in providing solutions of electrical energy distribution problems to get to remote or isolated areas is to optimize the potential of renewable energy in an area. The combination of conventional power plants (diesel generators) with renewable energy (photovoltaic and wind turbine) power plants is expected to solve the problem of electricity service in isolated areas in southern Tulungagung regency, namely residential area in Brumbun Beach. The existence of government assistance in the form of solar panels distributed to each family head still can not optimize the utilization of electrical energy for 24 h in a day, this is because the generation of diesel generators and solar panels are done separately. This research focuses on the design and analysis of renewable autonomous power supply system which consists of centralized solar-powered diesel generator (solar panel – wind turbine – diesel generator) systems using HOMER software. This software is in addition to being used to create designs, is also capable of performing the most optimal system design evaluation by sorting based on overall cost, basic electricity tariff, and carbon dioxide gas emissions. The research from the design of four power plant configurations shows that the use of 10 kW diesel generators, 8 kW solar panels, and 6 kW wind turbines is the best solution, from the combination of the three energy sources shows the net present cost value of US $ 44,680, Cost of Energy of 0.268 kWh/$, CO2 emissions of 1,077 kg/year, and diesel generator use only 54 min a day. © 2020, Econjournals.

This paper presents a design approach for a wind turbine (WT)/hydrogen HMS with eight alternative small horizontal-axis WTs and arrives at a conclusion based on the total annual cost (TAC), cost of energy (COE), and the loss of power supply possibility throughout the project's life cycle. The effect of adding solar panels to the HMS is investigated in different scenarios. The modified bio-inspired optimization algorithm with high efﬁciency is used, and its results are validated using an original particle swarm optimization in different unavailability levels. Owing to a sensitivity analysis that utilized the wind speed, load demand, and interest rate, the potential of the proposed algorithm to achieve the optimal off-grid HMS design was highlighted. Among the investigated systems (more than 16 systems), the Winds WT/hydrogen energy/solar configuration with $11,952 TAC and 0.3458$/kWh COE has the minimum cost while setting the unavailability level to 2%. In addition, the adding of solar panels, variation of small WT models, wind speed, load demand, and interest rate levels have a significant impact on COE value and number of components. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

This study provides a strategic framework to balance the supply and demand fluctuation for RES-based microgrids in an isolated area. By proposing the NILM, the load can be separately monitored for load shedding later when a critical condition occurs. NILM based on Data-Flow Programming (BDT) offers an appropriate NILM method to be applied to isolated areas. The infrastructure needed to implement the proposed method is related to building a monitoring station equipped with a set of computers and sensors so that the NILM algorithm can proceed. The load shedding and load priority algorithm are also presented in this study to achieve customer satisfaction. The method was developed by considering the limitations of infrastructure in communication, transportation, and other technologies in isolated areas. Therefore, it is necessary to have good cooperation between grid operators and consumers so that the proposed method can work properly. © 2022 Regional Energy Resources Information Center (RERIC), Asian Institute of Technology.

	abstract = {Renewable energy systems are technologically matured and promising to replace conventional fossil fuel energy systems that produce greenhouse gas emissions. However, renewable energy generation also encounters problems such as power quality issues. The intermittency nature of renewable energy resources, such as varying irradiance of solar PV and wind speed of wind energy in an isolated area, has potentially led to voltage fluctuations on the source side and generate harmonic distortion due to the inverter switching process. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the power quality issues of a standalone solar photovoltaic/microhydro/wind energy system. This study adopts an off-grid solar photovoltaic/micro-hydro system in Teluk Sumbang, East Borneo, Indonesia, as a case study to construct a renewable energy system. For this purpose, voltage fluctuations may vary about ±10% of its nominal value according to IEC standards. Total harmonic distortion (THD) indices according to IEEE standard 519-2014 are used. The simulation model is developed and observed using MATLAB/Simulink environment. A three-phase inverter with closed-loop voltage control insulated gate bipolar transistor inverter is applied to convert DC to AC and supply power to AC loads. LC and LCL filters use to minimize the harmonics distortion injected by the inverter switching process. Results show that under intermittency nature of renewable energy sources leads to power quality issues concerning voltage fluctuation. THD of voltage and current of the systems are less than 8%, and it is still within an acceptable range in IEEE standard limitation. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The aim of this work is to develop dual purposes solar heating system using heat pipe evacuated tube solar collector. The heat transfer fluid between the thermal loads and the solar collector loop was heating oil. The study provided two thermal loads; solar water heating system and solar baking/cooking system that had experimentally investigated under various weather conditions. The experimental pilot unit was installed in Solar Energy Department, National Research Centre, Giza, Egypt. Several test runs were performed to measure all assigned parameters that affect the system performance. The system is designed to provide high thermal energy through hot oil surrounding the inner vessel of the baker while the raw food can be baked/cooked and the outlet thermal energy can be used for heating water via immersed coil in the hot water storage tank; then the relatively cooled oil is returned to the solar collector via hot oil circulating pump. The water tank heat exchanger is designed with the following design parameters; specific heat of oil and water were 1.67 kJ/kg °C and 4.186 kJ/kg °C respectively; density of oil and water were 850 kg/m3 and 1000 kg/m3 respectively; mass flow rate of oil and water were 12 liters/min and 6 liters/min respectively. It is clear that the system in addition to provide thermal energy for baking/cooking unit, it can provide thermal energy for water heating purposes. The tested system can be positively contributed in baking and cooking purposes and providing hot water as well. It is found that, for the same flow rates of hot oil and water, as the hot oil temperature difference increased, the outlet hot water increased. The system is capable to produce hot water temperature up to 85 °C if the hot oil temperature difference was 100 °C while it can produce hot water temperature about 60 °C if the hot oil temperature difference was 60 °C during the day which is suitable for residential purposes and industrial process as well. Based on the resultant data, it is found that the system solar fraction was estimated as 54%. The auxiliary heating system can be electric source in case of using in urban areas and can be renewable energy source like biogas or hydrogen fuels in rural and isolated areas.  © 2021 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC).},

Within this context, in this study, the challenges related to microgrids and data analysis are presented, and different relevant data architectures described in the literature are compared. This paper focuses on the design of a data architecture for a smart microgrid for NIZs whose microgrid contains two 260 W solar panels, a 480 W inverter, and two 260 Ah batteries. Regarding the Colombian context, this paper describes the limitations (connectivity, isolation, appropriation of technologies) and opportunities (low demand, access to natural resources, state interest) from which the functional and non-functional requirements for the architecture are established.

	abstract = {Irrigation systems to supply water to agricultural land are essential in remote and isolated areas. However, these areas often face challenges and obstacles in obtaining energy for use in irrigation since many depend on diesel generators (DGs) to produce electricity. A farm located in a remote area in Al-Jafr, Jordan, uses a 100 kW DG to supply its need for electric energy for irrigation purposes. Its energy consumption is 500 kWh/day at $0.29/kWh. This paper designs a new hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) for this farm by conducting simulations using the HOMER (Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources) software. This new system consists of solar photovoltaics (PVs), batteries, an inverter, and a 100 kW DG. The results showed a clear difference between the baseline DG-only system and the hybrid system regarding energy cost and carbon emissions. The energy price for the HRES is $0.107/kWh, and carbon dioxide emissions are reduced to 27,378 kg/yr from 184,917 kg/yr for the DG-only system. In addition, simulations and comparisons for an alternative HRES with a 60 kW DG were conducted. Based on the simulation results, the energy price was $0.091 instead of $0.19, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were 15,847 kg/yr instead of 115,090 kg/yr. It was concluded that using hybrid renewable energy systems to power the irrigation of remote areas successfully reduced the energy cost, fuel consumption, emissions, and overall cost. The HOMER program makes an accurate comparison over extended periods between the four strategies (load following, cycle charging, combined dispatch, and predictive dispatch) and selects the optimal system based on the cost, emissions, fuel consumption, and percentage of renewable energy from the system.

The key feature of this system is the direct connection of the photovoltaic (PV) array to the drive, eliminating the need for the DC-DC converter. This direct connection simplifies the system architecture, reduces losses, and improves overall performance. The system employs an inverter to control an asynchronous motor, which can be utilized for various applications. In this study, we specifically focus on the pumping application, which is crucial in isolated areas where PV systems are commonly used for water pumping. By utilizing the asynchronous motor, economic control law and eliminating the DC-DC converter, the system achieves increased efficiency and reduced costs, making it a viable solution for remote locations. To track the maximum power available, an MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) algorithm is employed. The algorithm utilizes drive measurements to track and extract the maximum power from the PV array. The used strategy is based on PI controller to regulate the DC bus voltage by changing the motor speed reference. The proposed system and control strategy are validated through simulations and experimentation. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the effectiveness of the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithms of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Indeed, two efficient new control MPPT algorithms presented are based on the Perturb and Observe (P&O) method with a fixed step. The two suggested controllers are Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The first one uses Multilayer perceptron (MLP) learned by Levenberg Marquard (LM) learning algorithm as a neural regulator named (POPI-LMNN). The second one uses an Adaptative linear Neuron type (Adaline) learned by least mean square algorithm (LMS). The controllers are applied to a DC-DC boost converter inside a standalone solar photovoltaic conversion system used to feed an isolated area. As a result, the responses achieved through the learning approaches are more convincing. That is to say, they are faster and more efficient in terms of the power conversion. This is used to override the limitations of the traditional P&O technique, which are the fluctuations around the maximum power point with their low response tracking performance in the most severe cases of changing weather conditions. A comparative study between the three algorithms is done using Matlab/Simulink Simpower system environment. The results of simulation demonstrate that the Adaline presents a very high performance in terms of rapidity and elimination of oscillations with a conserving energy. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

	abstract = {Community renewable energy and citizens' energy needs are crucial issues on the global political agenda. The indispensable legislative and regulatory, while also the necessary technological, societal and behavioral developments in order to support the energy transition will require public understanding and ownership to deliver their full potential. The main discussion is how to enable low-carbon energy transitions based on renewable-energy technologies such as wind turbines, solar panels, biogas plants or geothermal plants. Digitalization of energy and distributed storage are shaping the future of electricity use. Micro Grids (MG) on the other hand represent the means by which the purpose will be achieved. In Tilos island Technology Innovation for the Local Scale Optimum Integration of Battery Energy Storage (TILOS) case, it has been identified that the Quadruple Helix's (QH) components are accelerating the transfer of research and innovation results to regional growth while stressing the replicating potentials. Taking into consideration all parameters involved, while learning from pioneers' evidence, low-carbon energy transition and energy supply for isolated areas can be achieved. Finally the energy ecosystem space metamorphosis creates the new emerging structures and norms. © 2019},

	abstract = {The policy decision of extending electric power transmission lines to connect a remote area to a primary grid vs. developing local electricity generation resources must be informed by studies considering both alternatives’ economic and environmental outcomes. Such analysis must also consider the uncertainty of several factors such as fuel prices, the cost and performance of renewable and conventional power generation technologies, and the value of environmental benefits. This paper presents a method for this analysis, making two main contributions to the literature. First, it shows how to characterize the two alternatives (i.e., main-grid extension vs. local power generation) in detail for precise quantification of their capital and operating costs while guaranteeing that they are both adequate to meet forecast demand and operating reserves. Second, it shows how to properly account for the economic and environmental implications of renewable energy intermittency and uncertainty through the optimization of capital investments and hourly operations. The method is illustrated by applying this analysis method to Saudi Arabia, where the government is struggling to outline a strategy to meet residential and commercial loads reliably and sustainably in the country’s remote, scattered, isolated areas. To meet this demand, the Saudi government is considering two main alternatives: (1) extending the primary power transmission grid; or (2) installing an optimal combination of off-grid distributed generation (DG) resources, including solar PV, wind, diesel, oil, heavy fuel oil, and Li-ion batteries, to generate the electricity locally. Results suggest that under most scenarios of capital costs, fuel prices, and costs of air pollution, developing a microgrid with a large share of wind and solar power is more cost-effective than extending a primary grid 150 km or more away. Extending a primary grid powered by gas-fired combined-cycle power plants is more economical only if the load is not very high, the distance is not more than 350 km, and oil prices are relatively high compared to natural gas. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The effect of cracks in solar cells on the long-term degradation of photovoltaic (PV) modules remains to be determined. To investigate this effect in future studies, it is necessary to quantitatively describe the crack features (e.g., length) and correlate them with module power loss. Electroluminescence (EL) imaging is a common technique for identifying cracks. However, it is currently challenging and time-consuming to identify cracks in a large number of EL images and quantify complex crack features by human inspection. This article introduces a fast semantic segmentation method (∼0.18 s/cell) to automatically segment cracks from EL images and algorithms to extract crack features. We fine-tuned a UNet neural network model using pretrained VGG16 as the encoder and obtained an average F1 score of 0.875 and an intersection over union score of 0.782 on the testing set. With cracks and busbars segmented, we developed algorithms for extracting crack features, including the crack-isolated area, the brightness inside the isolated area, and the crack length. We also developed an automatic preprocessing tool for cropping individual cell images from EL images of PV modules (∼0.72 s/module). Our codes are published as open-source an software, and our annotated dataset composed of various types of cells is published as a benchmark for crack segmentation in EL images.  © 2011-2012 IEEE.},

Another major pest of potatoes, the green peach aphid, is also very adaptable to insecticides. Both of these insects can also develop resistance to nonchemical methods of their suppression, such as biological control and crop rotation. In addition, understanding insect adaptation to abiotic conditions (temperature, water availability, solar irradiation, etc.) is essential for forecasting future pest outbreaks under the current conditions of extensive human traffic among previously geographically isolated areas and changing climate. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Tele-healthcare system using digital technologybased telemedicine is widely used across various medical specialties. To solve limitation of medical resources in hospital located in remote isolated areas, telehealthcare system using smart application has been applied to access expert opinions in pre-coronavirus disease (COVID-19) era since 2017. The COVID-19 has spread also in this island during COVID-19 period. We have experienced three consecutive neuroemergency patients. Their ages and final diagnoses were: 98 years with subdural hematoma (case 1), 76 years with post-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (case 2), and 65 years with cerebral infarction (case 3), respectively. The tele-counseling could save two of three transportations to tertiary hospital and also save 6,000 US dollars per case for transportation by helicopter. From these three cases counseled through smart app which has been started to use 2 years before COVID-19 emerged in 2020, what this case series would report are the following two viewpoints: (1) medicoeconomic benefits exist in tele-healthcare system in COVID-19 era and (2) developing telehealthcare systems must be prepared that is available even when the electricity system has been shut down, for instance solar system that could.

However, the increasing cost and harmful emissions of these fuels have led researchers to seek alternative solutions in providing electricity. Hence, harnessing renewable resources can be a favourable solution in lowering the dependency on fossil fuels. The Strait of Malacca is blessed with tidal current energy, a research was conducted to design a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) that consists of tidal current and solar energy as its sources along with backup power such as generators to support the electrical demand of a lighthouse. A simulation method is used to determine and compare the optimal configuration of the HRES with the diesel generator-based system. An evaluation of all possible scenarios of standalone systems was carried out by considering the amount of fuel consumption and pollutant emittance, capacity shortage, excess electricity production, unmet energy and renewable fraction parameters of each system scenario. From the findings, the hybrid energy system of Scenario A that consists of tidal turbines, PVs, generator, battery, and converter produces better results where the diesel fuel consumption can be reduced up to 84% in comparison with the standalone generator-based system. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

In isolated areas where access to the grid is limited or restricted, a stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) system is particularly effective. In such a system, the available electrical energy mainly depends on the solar irradiance and the capacities of the PV array and battery. In this paper, we develop an optimization method for designing a residential off-grid PV system. The method determines the number of PV panels and battery modules for cost-effectively operating the system. We use a mixed-integer programming model to pre-schedule the daily usage of appliances according to a forecasted solar irradiance. The schedule is then executed on a Monte Carlo simulation that considers the uncertainty of the solar irradiance. An integer Nelder-Mead (N-M) algorithm determines the size of the PV-Battery system. The performance of the method is measured using plane of irradiance data at two locations in the USA. We perform a sensitivity analysis by changing the cost of the battery and the penalty cost of non-served energy. In addition, we investigate the effects of scheduling, forecast solar irradiance variability, and battery degradation. © 2020 International Solar Energy Society},

	abstract = {Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms play a key role in a photovoltaic (PV) energy conversion system, which should inherently operate at its maximum available power. Genetic algorithms (GA) have shown their capability to solve different optimization problems and also their superiority to many other methods. In this paper, a GA-based MPPT algorithm is implemented to extract the maximum power from an off-grid PV system. To convert the generated DC power from the PV arrays into adequate AC power to supply different types of loads, a double-stage power conversion topology is adopted. A DC-DC boost converter is firstly, connected to the terminals of the PV modules. The GAbased MPPT algorithm is, thereafter, implemented to adjust the duty cycle of the boost converter in a way to achieve MPP operation of the PV modules. Then, a stand-alone PV inverter is connected in cascade with the boost converter to feed the AC loads. A numerical model of the whole PV conversion platform is developed using Matlab/Simulink software. Thereafter, different simulation tests are performed considering a real case of an off-grid PV installation located in the city of Mzaougha, Monastir (Tunisia) in an isolated area from distribution grid of the national company of electricity. An adequate PV module, which satisfies the energetic needs of the site is also selected and its real model is used for simulations. The obtained results confirm the feasibility of the proposed technique and its effectiveness in controlling an off-grid PV system. © 2023 IEEE.},

The LeTID-degraded sample, however, has a larger signal corresponding to a trap density of 1.1 × 1013 cm-3, which is about five times larger than the 2.1 × 1012 cm-3 trap density of the regenerated sample. An increase in filling pulse time from 50 μs to 20 ms shows a slight decrease in activation energy from 0.42 to 0.36 eV suggesting that the defect level may consist of a band of energy states where shallower states continue to fill with long filling times. The capture rate of the defect is directly measured using an increasing series of filling pulsewidths in 15 to 125 ns range. This leads to a measured capture cross section of 5.1 × 10-17 cm2, and using an approximate defect density of 1013 cm-3, the majority-carrier-hole lifetime related to this defect is approximately 100 μs when in the LeTID-degraded state.  © 2011-2012 IEEE.},

It represents a clean source of energy, available with abundant quantities with very good average daily solar radiation of about 5.5 kW h/m2/day. The present work provides a comprehensive study for a complete design of the solar pumping system components with different water demands. A computer program is designed and developed to offer the system design and the solar simulation model is presented. The hydraulic power, photovoltaic (PV) peak power, PV required area, and total system costs for different total dynamic heads and different water demands ranged from 1–1000 m3/day are calculated. The present research is a good tool for designers, users, and buyers of such systems. It is found that the PV solar water pumping system is more economically feasible than diesel generators up to a water demand of 100 m3/day. The model is a needed tool for all concerned in the field of PV solar water pumping including costumers. © 2020, Allerton Press, Inc.},

HPS utilizes renewable energy as the main source combined with a diesel engine generator as a backup energy source. The renewable energy used can come from solar energy, wind energy, and others. Sebotok Village, located in Labuhan Badas sub-district, Sumbawa regency, West Nusa Tenggara province, is an isolated area that uses 4 diesel generator units as a source of electricity generation. The purpose of this research is to identify potential renewable energy resources (wind and solar) and to develop a design and analysis of the economic feasibility of HPS in the region. The design feasibility analysis of the Hybrid Power Plant was carried out using the Hybrid Optimization Model of Electric Renewables (HOMER Energy) simulation. This system is a combination of Wind/PV//Diesel, battery, DC/DC converter, and DC/AC inverter. The simulation results show the configuration of 160 kW PV, 160 kW PV Inverter, 100 kW diesel generator, 24 battery units, and 10 kW Converter with a dispatch strategy of load following. The configuration has the lowest Cost of Energy (COE) value of 0.139 kWh and the lowest Total Net Present Cost (NPC) of 1.06 Million. Meanwhile, the sensitivity simulation shows that the COE value is most influenced by the price of diesel fuel, the cost of PV, and solar radiation, respectively. © 2021 IEEE.},

As the space exploration will guide us further away from Earth, delay will impact real time interaction and tele operated systems will no longer be usable. Our objective was to design a solution which allows a novice to locate the probe on the acoustic window and to get a medically usable view of any organ without any assistance. Our solution uses an augmented reality application to assist the novice operator in performing an echography. Before flight, the software enables an expert sonographer to save the cartesian probe coordinates corresponding to the perfect position and orientation of an ultrasound probe to get the perfect 2D echographic image of an organ. In-flight, the novice operator is able to retrieve the probe's position registered preflight thanks to an augmented reality visualization on the subject body. The protocol has been tested on a 3-day parabolic flight campaign. The solution allowed to find the AW in 88% and a 2D image in 82% of the 34 organs investigated. This tool will allow a reliable ultrasound medical surveillance during long distance space trip with no realtime link with earth. Its usage may be extended to isolated areas and medical deserts that cannot benefit from the precious tool that is ultrasonography.

	abstract = {For many socio-economic and demographic issues, majority of the Egyptian population live near the Nile River for thousands of years. Shortage of freshwater resources at remote and rural areas is limiting population settlement and development. Therefore, it is necessary to find alternative solutions including saline water desalination processes to assist obtaining fresh water for domestic and industrial purposes in these remote areas. The energy needed for the desalination process represents another challenge due to the available fossil fuel limitation, increasing prices and their negative impacts on the environment. These challenges may be tackled by applying hybrid renewable energy (RE) resources such as solar and wind energies as the driving power for the desalination technologies. Many studies are conducted in Egypt, Middle East region and worldwide investigating the possibilities of different desalination systems driven by RE. This article presents a recent review of the global desalination processes with a focus on membrane desalination systems such as reverse osmosis (RO), membrane distillation (MD), hybrid desalination technologies and processes as well as advanced plasmonic nanomaterials for water distillation derived by RE suitable for remote and isolated areas. Some recent activities for coupling desalination systems with hybrid RE carried-out by the co-authors will be highlighted.  © The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

The methodology is based on a comparison of three small-scale farm business models: a farm without any milk cooling equipment, a farm using an innovative milk cooling technology, and a farm using an electrical cooling tank. Results showed the significance of milk cooling in reducing milk rejection to 0%, leading to a total production of 6400 L per cow by the fifth year. Additionally, milk sales were found to increase due to the premium of 0.010 TND/L for cooled milk paid. In addition, farms utilizing solar-powered milk cooling technology exhibited superior profitability in terms of financial indicators.

	abstract = {Renewable energy source in isolated area, or mainly known as standalone system should be reliable and resilient in terms of power stability and power quality. In its intermittency characteristics, it is often forfeiting its energy storage lifespan due to significant charge and discharge amount of power to the energy storage. To resolve the problem, this research proposed an evaluation for a design of wind turbine penetration in standalone photovoltaic system using hybrid storage system (battery and supercapacitor), remembering the intermittency of its source has complementary characteristics in a remote area, when the solar is out of reach, the wind could give the peak contribution. This research provides the wind turbine penetration stability performance and the effect for the system. From the results, the characteristics obtained that after the penetration of wind turbine, the penetration affected the photovoltaic, in both current and power by the decrease of 2,357% and reached its steady state in 0,066 s and 0,034 s respectively. For the load, the penetration affected by increasing the power at 5,095% and back to its normal state at 0,049 s. Meanwhile for the supercapacitor and battery, the steady-state time after the penetration is 0,113 and 0,117 respectively, and also the energy storage proven to be the compensator for the oscillation effect after the penetration. © 2022 IEEE.},

On-grid photovoltaic installations supply energy to consumers as a support energy source, but in isolated areas, it comes as the unique source. The decision-maker must dimension the installation, maintaining system performance with reasonable investments. In some scenarios, the utility manager can handle the energy delivered to consumers as every subsystem can be independently connected. A strategy for scheduling the energy consumption to decrease the number of photovoltaic modules required in a standalone system is proposed here. The problem formulation corresponds to generalising a more specific problem before published.

	abstract = {Water scarcity is a serious problem in several regions, especially in isolated communities located in desert or arid areas of the world. One of the most promising solutions to address this problem is desalination. Solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation technology has demonstrated that it can be an ideal and clean alternative to fossil fuels, especially in remote and isolated areas where there is no accessibility to power grids, or such accessibility is difficult. The integration of desalination plants with solar PV systems for water production is nearly competitive because of both the decreasing trend of PV prices and the increasing trend of fossil fuel prices over recent years. The generated electricity by PV systems integrated with desalination plants can be utilized to drive electromechanical devices, including pumps and fans, electric heaters, etc., and in a larger range, any direct-current (DC) apparatus. The most mature conventional desalination technologies for integration with solar PV systems are reverse osmosis (RO) and electrodialysis (ED). Due to operating RO based on alternative current (AC), a DC/AC inverter is required while ED systems operate based on DC current. Membrane distillation is another desalination technology that requires thermal power to operate, but PV modules can also be integrated to supply the required electricity for other attached equipment. In addition, the integration of PV modules with solar stills, which are the most favorable alternatives in remote areas for supplying freshwater, has great potential to overcome some of the problems regarding conventional distillation systems. In all mentioned PV-powered desalination systems, energy storage or an electricity back-up system is critical to guarantee sustained operation. The main barrier for worldwide deployment of PV-powered desalination systems is the high investment costs, resulting in high produced water costs. However, there is huge potential for further enhancement of performance, energy savings, and cost reductions. © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The SSPV system is more suited for electrification of essential loads uses DC power as it offers high efficiency. This work aims to model and simulate SSPV with lead acid battery is used as a DC source. The proposed series shunt charge controller with power management strategy (PMS)is designed and modeled to control the power flow among SSPV, battery and the load. adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) controller effectively regulates the output voltage by controlling duty ratio of the suitable converter for driving a DC load. A PMS is developed for selecting the operating mode of SSCC by sensing and regulating the battery voltage within 11.6-12.95 V. Here, the 250 Wp panel has been employed to charge a 12 V, 34 AH battery. The practicability of SSPVB system is verified under various loaded conditions using MATLAB/Simulink for a period of 24 hours.

	abstract = {Each electric vehicle (EV) has a finite amount of energy storage capacity. The EV batteries need to be recharged after a certain amount of driving, and cities make good locations for charging facilities. However, finding a charging infrastructure can be difficult in isolated areas. Large countries including Canada, China, the US, India, Australia, Russia, and a few Arab states are proposing to install pillar top solar panels in remote places for emergency EV charging. This condition requires a specific charging adaptor to monitor the charging current, securely conclude the charging process, and extract the maximum power from the panel utilising MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking). This EV study proposes a sensor-based low-cost charging adapter. MPPT operation and battery charge monitoring should be completed using SIAFL-DO. Only one current sensor-based charging adapters are inexpensive and fast. Furthermore, the SIAFL-DO algorithm accurately executes MPPT and charging management thanks to its excellent condition estimation and decision-making capabilities. This work uses a hardware prototype to assess the adapter&#x0027;s compatibility with the SIAFL-DO algorithm. Additionally, comparison investigations using cutting-edge methods are carried out. The created technique is put to the test against the European Standard EN50530 in order to determine its applicability to the sector. IEEE},

	abstract = {Water scarcity is a global issue recognized by the United Nations under Goal 6 of its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which is to ‘Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all’. This challenging goal requires innovations, especially in areas with freshwater scarcity. Coupling this with the expected significant growth in population, especially in developing countries, presents major challenges to obtaining the appropriate levels of water provision needed. The development of seawater desalination technologies offers hope to alleviate freshwater shortages whilst supporting SDG 6. This research addresses the development of small-scale technology utilizing solar energy for providing clean drinking water in rural, hot, arid, and remote communities. To alleviate water scarcity in rural and isolated areas, a micro solar still (MSS) system that supports a multistage distillation process can be utilized, which evaporates and condenses the saline feed water into pure drinking water with highly efficient solar heat collectors. The focus of this study was to assess the performance of two prototypes, with minor improvements to the wicking structure. Such a system has the advantage of recycling wasted latent heat in the process to increase productivity. Two prototypes were tested to assess the performance of the solar still construction material and yield, and to test the water quality and quantity under the climatic conditions of Kuwait. The operation and efficiency of the prototypes were observed across four characteristics: solar irradiance, ambient temperatures, feed water and water production. The performances of the two prototypes were comparable to the results of previously published work on MSS prototypes that utilize wicking. The recovery rates of the two prototypes were 22 and 25%, respectively. The maximum production of potable water achieved from the two prototypes was 900 and 1160 g, respectively, using a feed of 4 and 3.7 kgs. The quality of the produced water met the WHO’s standards for drinking water. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Hydropower systems are the basis of electricity power generation in Ecuador. However, some isolated areas in the Amazon and Galapagos Islands are not connected to the National Interconnected System. Therefore, isolated generation systems based on renewable energy sources (RES) emerge as a solution to increase electricity coverage in these areas. An extraordinary case occurs in the Galapagos Islands due to their biodiversity in flora and fauna, where the primary energy source comes from fossil fuels despite their significant amount of solar resources. Therefore, RES use, especially photovoltaic (PV) and wind power, is essential to cover the required load demand without negatively affecting the islands’ biodiversity. In this regard, the design and installation planning of PV systems require perfect knowledge of the amount of energy available at a given location, where power forecasting plays a fundamental role. Therefore, this paper presents the design and comparison of different deep learning techniques: long-short-term memory (LSTM), LSTM Projected, Bidirectional LSTM, Gated Recurrent Units, Convolutional Neural Networks, and hybrid models to forecast photovoltaic power generation in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador. The proposed approach uses an optimized hyperparameter-based Bayesian optimization algorithm to reduce the forecast error and training time. The results demonstrate the accurate performance of all the methods by achieving a low-error short-term prediction, an excellent correlation of over 99%, and minimizing the training time. © 2023 by the authors.},

This concept would increase TSS ability to evaporate water from strong desiccant of calcium chloride under extreme low humid conditions. The TSS was opened and exposed to atmospheric air during night hours starting the absorption process. At the beginning of the sunrise, the TSS was closed and placed at the focal line of the parabolic concentrator starting the regeneration process. The proposed system was able to produce 0.51 L/kg of calcium chloride. The system thermal efficiency and water production cost were 24.61% and $0.15 respectively. The proposed device increased the productivity and the efficiency of the TSS by 292.4% and 82.3%, while reduced the water production cost by 25%.

	abstract = {Sewage treatment and water reuse are, undoubtedly, one of the main points on scientific agenda of the 21st century. Many technologies for sewage treatment are available; however, it is still as an open issue that deserves much attention in order to facilitate their application, develop more effective methods and propose alternative treatment for unusual situations. Developing high performance materials for sewage treatment fits the idea of the development of efficient and alternative methods for microorganism removal and the high organic load of wastewater and is of fundamental importance. In this paper, a heterojunction with perovskite-type strontium stannate (SrSnO3) and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) — SrSnO3/g-C3N4 — was synthesized and used for photocatalytic treatment of domestic sewage using only sunlight. Results were accompanied by assessing the total organic carbon decrease and removal of pathogenic microorganisms. X-ray diffraction and X-ray excited photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated that a heterostructure was successfully formed and photocatalytic tests showed an important activity in the visible range, i.e., under sunlight. Exposing raw sewage to 240 min (from 11 a.m. until 3 p.m.) in the presence of SrSnO3/g-C3N4, led to a 56.1% mineralization. This process was 2.5 more efficient than photolysis under sunlight. Moreover, the treated sewage showed no coliform growth (either fecal or total) or heterotrophic bacteria. This simple treatment makes sewage suitable and safe for reuse, for example, for agriculture purposes according to Brazilian regulations criteria and could be an alternative for isolated areas in which sewage treatment plants are not available. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Over the years, the fossil-fueled power stations used to generate electricity had a detrimental effects and it has necessitated the need for alternative energy sources such as solar, wind, biomass and other renewable energy sources. Hybrid energy system (HES) based on distributed energy resources (DERs) integration into the DC microgrid is considered as the viable means to carry out the electrification of rural as well as isolated area. However, DC microgrids are limited by the occurrence of faults and this affect their performance. This paper presents the modelling and simulation of power flow and the fault analysis in a hybrid DC microgrid. This hybrid DC microgrid is powered by PV and wind energy system, the formulation, modeling and simulations was implemented in the MATLAB/SIMULINK. The faults analyzed in the system are the DC line-to-ground faults and DC line-to-line faults. Results for a hybrid DC microgrid revealed that high quality of power is experienced in load distribution. Also based on the results, when DC faults occurs there is disturbance to output. © 2021 IEEE.},

The photovoltaic solar system, connected to the prototype house, supplied its electric loads (TV, Blu-ray, radio, refrigerator, blender, heater, washing machine, fan, iron), which were programmed to be turned on and off using digital timers during a period of 3 months (March, April and May 2020). The measured parameters were the solar power, the consumed electrical power and the electrical power of what would be an auxiliary source of energy (electric generator, for example) in case the solar resource is unavailable. The results indicate that the photovoltaic solar system could store the unused solar energy to supply the nighttime electrical loads, ensuring, in this way, the autonomy of the energy system. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

	abstract = {In this study, a fully solar-driven water desalination system is designed, fabricated, and tested. The proposed system is designed for remote, isolated areas with limited electricity and freshwater access. For commercial PVDF membranes, the performance of the MD unit is evaluated at various feed temperatures, flow rates, and salt concentrations. In addition, the effect of MD cell design was examined to determine the effect of the obstacles on the feed channel. Increasing the temperature by 20 degrees from 55 to 75 °C enhances productivity by 165 % from 6.2 to 16.4 kg/m2.h. At different operating conditions, the new design of the MD cell with cylindrical obstacles attained higher flux productivity compared to the conventional MD cell design. The maximum attained freshwater output flux was around 15 kg/m2.h at a feed inlet temperature of 65 °C and feed mass flowrate of 66 kg/h for the MD cell with cylindrical obstacles. In the presence of obstacles, a reduction in the specific energy consumption (SEC) by 35–15 % is associated with an increase in the gain output ratio (GOR) by 50–20 % compared to the case of no obstacles. Observations indicate that a small PV module with an area of 0.377 m2 is sufficient to operate the membrane unit for contentious 15 h. Collectively, using solar MD units collectively has the potential to be used for decentralized desalination of water. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

To mitigate the detrimental impacts of the conventional energy resources, this paper provides an idea about an off-grid, distributed solar-piezo power generating technique usable for residential & isolated area applications. The primary power is supplied by the solar panel, and the subordinate power can be added by the produced energy from the piezoelectric modules, and the battery model is employed for continuous power supply in the suggested hybrid renewable power system.Furthermore, the dc-dc boost converter for PV and piezoelectric modules is designed to connect two power inputs in parallel. The present study focuses upon the design of the proposed system & scopes of the proposed system in Tripura, a hilly state in the North-Eastern Province of India.Tripura has ranked 56th amongst 100 smart cities in the countryaccording to Smart City rankings released in July 2020 & also 1st among all the North-Eastern states. Thus, the motto of the paper is to draw attention towards implementation of green energy harvesting techniques in Tripura which will certainly help to mitigate the techno-economic barriers in the region &successfully mitigating the energy requirements. The modelling and simulation of the proposed hybrid arrangement has been carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK.

	abstract = {This article is dedicated to search of right balance for heat and power supply of distributed villages in different conditions in Russia. Russia has a huge territory that is not connected to power grids, many villages aren't connected to natural gas network and don't have district heating systems. Approach consists of several steps. On the first step we choose isolated areas and villages that have no chances to get connection to natural gas grid. Even if they are connected to power grids, they still have a room for autonomic solutions in producing heat/hot water. In many cases quality of power is not very good. Then on the second step we compare different combinations of traditional (LNG/CNG/LPG/diesel) and renewable (PV panels, solar collectors, wind turbines + heat/power storage units) power sources in order to find the best way of power/heat supply for the village. In the article the approach is shown on two different examples - Dagestan (south of Russia) and Yakutia (north of Russia). Article also covers some ways and proposals of renewable energy supporting considering current situation in this industry. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

In this work, we propose a sizing model for a Solar Pumping System according to the available energy and the identified uses.

The objective of this study is to optimise the pumping system to ensure the availability of energy as close as possible to the needs so that the isolated areas benefit from it in line with their resources. We illustrate the validation of the proposed method by three scenarios.

	abstract = {Bangladesh is a country of small char lands and islands. Most of these are out of national grid coverage. Therefore, renewable energy technology (RET) is the only solution for electrification. However, proper investigation and research are needed to select the most suitable renewable energy technology. In this study, focus is given on the southern region of the country to select the best RET. Based on the currently available technology and potentiality of the renewable energy resources in the country, five types of RETs are selected for evaluation. These are solar, wind, biomass to electricity, biogas to electricity and solar-wind-battery hybrid energy system. To evaluate the best RET, Multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDM) method is used where an integrated Entropy-EDAS (Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution) model is proposed to identify the best RET in the study area. At first, the key criteria and sub-criteria were selected to analyse five (5) types of RETs. These criteria were categorised as economic, technical, environmental, and socio-political. Additionally, 12 sub-criteria were selected under the umbrella of four main criteria. Then, Shannon's Entropy method was deployed to find the weights of the criteria and sub-criteria. Finally, a new MCDM method, named EDAS, was applied to select the best RET in the study area. The results revealed that the Solar-Wind-Battery hybrid energy system is the best option. The outcome of this study and the decision model might be applicable to other isolated areas in the country, particularly in the southern region of Bangladesh. © 2019 International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.},

	abstract = {In Ecuador, electricity generation is mainly covered by renewable energy sources that feed the National Interconnected System (NIS). Its economical price means that the installation of systems based on non-conventional renewable energy sources does not represent a benefit for the user. However, rural communities isolated from the NIS do not have electricity services. Due to this, isolated systems become an effective option to supply electricity to these communities. In this regard, the Galapagos Islands have unique biodiversity in the world. Since they are not connected to the NIS, their primary energy sources are based on biogas obtained from fossil fuels, with their negative consequences despite the great potential of solar resources. Hence the need to use non-conventional renewable energy sources that covers the energy demand and do not affect the biodiversity there. Photovoltaic energy forecasting is an essential step in the installation of photovoltaic systems. Prediction models based on deep learning (DL) techniques can obtain a high degree of accuracy in energy prediction tasks. For this reason, this work presents the development of long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) models to predict photovoltaic energy in an isolated area of Ecuador. The results highlight the performance of both methods through the achieved short-term prediction.  © 2022 IEEE.},

With this aim, a self-sustainable pilot prototype based on three combined modules (disc-filtration, granular activated carbon (GAC) bed adsorption and UV disinfection) assisted by solar panels was installed as an alternative tertiary treatment in a conventional WWTP in the Murcia region. The obtained results clearly confirmed the efficiency of the proposed prototype for CECs removal, and showed optimal results at a workflow of 500 L/h. In all cases, high removal efficiency was obtained for the different indicator microorganisms described in the recently published Regulation (EU) 2020/741 (E. coli, F-specific coliphages, somatic coliphages, total coliphages, and Clostridium perfringens). The protection of the activated carbon by disc-filters and the energy autonomy and self-operation of the prototype resulted in an efficient and economically viable methodology for its implementation in both conventional WWTPs and in isolated areas attached to crops. © 2020 by the authors.},

Among various renewable energy sources, solar power is usable everywhere as long as there is solar radiation. It is particularly useful for isolated areas where there is no access to any other source of electricity. However, the inherent uncertainty of solar radiation and climate changes may result in a high initial investment cost that could make this type of energy system economically infeasible. To obtain a PV-battery system at a reasonable investment cost, a home-backup diesel generator is assumed to be available. We develop a scenario-based optimization model to determine the capacity of residential off-grid PV-battery systems that consider solar radiation uncertainty and hourly energy consumption patterns. The optimization model determines the PV-battery capacities to supply the energy demanded at each period by minimizing the annual equivalent investment cost and the fuel cost of using the diesel generator. The impact of scenarios on the model results is evaluated by changing the number of scenarios. © 2022},

This type of power plant is called a floating power plant or barge-mounted power plant or barge. Floating power plants can use a various of energy sources, such as steam energy, gas energy, nuclear energy, solar energy, ocean current energy, and sea wave energy. According to the plan for a nuclear power plant ship to be built on the island of Bangka, it is necessary to consider the aspects of evaluating the safety of the nuclear power plant site. This paper discusses the elements of site safety evaluation for nuclear power plants using descriptive methods and qualitatively with literature studies. The site evaluation of the floating power plants must be carried out in accordance with the existing laws and regulations, even though the regulations in Indonesia are addressed to land-based power reactors and the evaluations related to buildings and installations in the sea for electricity installations may refer to the existing regulations, which is Government Regulation Number 27 of 2021 concerning the Implementation of the Marine and Fisheries Sector, which regulates power generating ships. This study concludes that the regulation for site safety evaluation that applies to land-based nuclear reactors is still applicable for floating nuclear power plants. © 2023 Author(s).},

However, the majority of study has been focused on the techno-economic aspects of producing electricity in support of this isolated area. To bridge the gap, the present study proposes a methodology for assessing off-grid hybrid microgrid pertaining to the priorities of four key sustainability performance indicators (KSPI): economy, environment, technology, and society. The evaluation process also includes total 13 sets of sub-indicators under KSPI, such as levelized cost of energy, return on investment, CO2 emissions, renewable fraction, excess electricity, unmet load, land usage, job creation etc. The comprehensive value of KSPI regarding economic, environmental, technical, and social priorities are computed using fuzzy logic Mamdani type rules, which facilitates human judgment in linguistic terms and eliminates weightage ambiguity. Seven microgrid scenarios integrating locally accessible resources have been scored and ranked to identify suitable configuration. According to the findings, the PV/Wind/Diesel/Converter/Battery combination reveals best option considering economic priority. On the other hand, the PV/Wind/Converter/Battery alternative receives excellent performance scores and is recommended in both environmental and social categories. However, the PV/Diesel/Converter/Battery arrangement outperforms the others architectures and gets preference for technical reasons. Additionally, the electrical, financial, emission, and sensitivity analysis are carried out for a selected microgrid in Kutubdia. This assessment framework can assist academics, policymakers and investors for planning microgrid in a better way based on sustainable dimensions.  © 2013 IEEE.},

From 2015 to 2019 the La Cumbre population was reinforced by translocation of wild juveniles from the source population of Inagua. We estimate the population size, the spatial variation of abundance, and recent temporal changes in density of the species in Inagua and La Cumbre by means of line transects, distance sampling, and habitat suitability modelling using random forests. The average density of the Blue Chaffinch in Inagua Nature Reserve was 10.2 birds/km2 in spring 2019, with a population estimated at 362 birds (95% CI: 257-489). The most important variables affecting the distribution of the Blue Chaffinch in Inagua were the amount of precipitation during the summer (July-September), the solar radiation in June, and the northern position in the reserve, highlighting the importance of abiotic factors related to thermal and hydric stress during the breeding season. The density was considerably lower in the translocated population inhabiting 21 km2 of pine forests in La Cumbre (3.3 birds/km2), with an estimate of 68 Blue Chaffinches (35-141) breeding freely in the wild. The translocation programme successfully contributed to the establishment of a second viable nucleus, accounting for 16% of the total population within a time span of 10 years. This result reinforces the role of translocations in preventing extinctions of endangered species with very low population sizes restricted to only one isolated area.  ©},

	abstract = {Reducing pollution in the environment is the most important topic of the present times. Pollution mainly arises from the burning of fossil fuel which emits CO2 and other harmful gases in the environment. The transportation sector is introducing technologically advanced Electric Vehicles (EVs) which are eco-friendly. EV integration to the grid is the attraction of many researchers and engineers around the world due to the rapidly growing numbers of EVs in the global market. The use of EVs in the grid will play an important role in future smart grid technology. But EVs charging puts significant load demand on the grid as well as uneven and uncoordinated charging creates disturbance in the grid. In order to reduce the burden on the grid, the EVs can be charged by Renewable Energy Resources (RESs). Solar is the most widely available renewable energy source. Solar charging stations can be installed at homes, offices, parking lots, public areas and isolated areas. The proposed system in this chapter is designed in the MATLAB Simulink environment in which Electric Vehicle (EV) is charged in a standalone solar power charging station and this EV is integrated into the grid when the solar power is unavailable. The use of a DC–DC bidirectional converter with appropriate controlling technique enables the transfer of power from EV to the grid whenever there is demand. The benefits and limitations of integrating EV in the power systems have been discussed in this chapter. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Economic development, productivity and competitiveness suffers or is stunted in many industries, in remote regions and many rural parts for want of small amounts of assured local electricity availability 24 x 7, either due to inadequate grid-coverage or an unreliable supply. A number of renewable energy schemes are being encouraged by central and state governments. Those schemes which are dependent on carbon-credits, or on continuation of presently available generous subsidies, or are secured through "political leverage" or "patronage", or rely on licensed imported technology, or without assured long-term off-take are all doubtful propositions commercially. Furthermore, small schemes do not appear to be attractive unless it can be demonstrated clearly that the LCOE (levellized cost of electricity) and the PP (payback-period) are attractive, irrespective of the conversion efficiency of heat into electricity. The lowtemperature ORC (Organic Rankine Cycle) scheme proposed herein meets all these criteria, is cost-effective and can be developed indigenously. The ORC plants are small, modular and scalable. They can be easily transported, assembled and commissioned at site rapidly, in small industrial units or incorporated into "micro-grids" for remote isolated areas. The heat-energy converter of the ORC plant is a hermetically sealed unit with very few moving parts. The technology is available now and proven. The plant requires no operator, the maintenance cost is negligible over long periods, and the unit can be operated and monitored remotely. The present chapter describes two ORC arrangements which were modelled for two types of heat sources in MATLAB software and Genetic Algorithm, which were used for parametric optimization to maximize the thermal efficiency for eight different working fluids. The novel objective of the study is to relate thermal efficiency and other parameters of the cycle with thermo physical properties of the working fluids for better selection. For more accurate results, isentropic efficiency of the scroll expander used was not fixed; instead a regression model was used to evaluate the efficiency with pressure ratio variation with fixed built in volume ratio. It was found that higher the critical pressure and smaller the chain length of the refrigerant, higher would be the thermal efficiency of the working fluid. For geothermal heat source, R11 had the maximum thermal efficiency of 14.9%. And for solar heat source, it was observed that Benzene had the maximum thermal efficiency of 9.6%. It was also observed that aromatic refrigerants like benzene and toluene are good for low temperature heat sources only. The average increment in thermal efficiency from basic ORC to recuperated ORC is 2.5% and 0.5% for geothermal and solar respectively which shows that recuperator is not a big advantage for low temperature heat sources. It was also found that the optimum pressure ratios for these two fluids were 8.23 and 5.03 which are very close to the peak of expander isentropic curve which signifies the importance of expander efficiency in performance analysis. © 2020 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

	abstract = {The PV solar system is one of the most popular renewable energy systems. Besides being easy to apply, the infrastructure is usually more flexible than other power plants and the resources can be found almost anywhere. Along with the increasingly frequent use of PV power plants in isolated areas, there are obstacles to land use, especially in island areas, where land has been used for housing and community activity areas, so that there is no location left for PV power plants placement. Therefore, the PV power plant is installed above the water surface, known as offshore floating PV. Offshore floating PV and conventional land PV have different ecosystems, so there will be differences in performance. The performance of the power system is one aspect of choosing which system is best to apply. In this research, the indicators of the performance of the power system are voltage, current, and power output. They will be compared between offshore floating PV and conventional PV on land. The research location is the Kudingarenglompo island, which is an island located off the coast of Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. 400kW is provided as system capacity, which is based on the existing power system on the island. The research results show that current and voltage on offshore floating PV are higher than conventional PV on land, so the power output from offshore floating PV is higher than on land PV. The average power output on land PV is 1,29% lower than on offshore floating PV. © 2021 IEEE.},

However, the autonomous Photovoltaic/Battery system, like all other renewable energy systems, has the same design and operating challenges: appropriate size and energy management. In this regard, the Electric systems Cascade Extended Analysis method is offered to overcome the design challenges of the system. The method includes two algorithms: the first is used to scale the system by determining the ideal battery capacity and the number of Photovoltaic panels required to fulfill a load profile. The first algorithm also includes techno-economic optimization based on the Life Cycle Cost and the Levelized Cost of Electricity as economic parameters and the Loss of Power Supply Probability as a technical indicator. The first algorithm is based on the study site's climatic data (solar irradiation & temperature) and the economic and technical of the panel and battery selected for the study. The second algorithm is used for optimal management. Each of the electrical load and the battery is electrically connected to the management system, which makes instant comparisons between the real-time load power and the desired load power to fix the intensity of the charge/discharge current of the battery by controlling the duty cycles of the bi-directional converter linked to the battery. The simulation and the experimental assembly of the system showed the method's high efficiency in optimally designing and operating Photovoltaic/Battery systems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

HOMER software was used to analyze the LCOE, and ArcGIS software was used for the visual modeling of water resources. As a result, the average LCOE for a purely PV installation supplying electricity to a pumping system in Tenerife is 0.2430 €/kWh, but the location and characteristic of each pumping system directly affect the performance and costs, mostly due to the solar availability. © 2022 by the authors.},

Photovoltaic solar systems today are one of the most promising technologies for on-site generation and accessible to communities with little economic resources. Each configuration of photovoltaic systems has advantages and disadvantages compared to the other, which are reviewed so that the reader has a clear idea of the convenience of implementing this type of systems. The document reviews commercial software for the simulation, analysis, and sizing of renewable energy systems, selecting two software’s for the sizing and comparison of centralized and decentralized systems. Simulation results indicate that the centralized system has a lower energy cost, however the software analyzed does not consider the laying costs of the micro-network distribution lines of the case or study or distribution losses. The cost of energy in the decentralized system is $0.66/kWh and 0.64 $/kWh for centralized, centralized installations require fewer batteries to store surplus energy produced by photovoltaic panels. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Solar energy has a good potential in several agriculture applications especially in rural and isolated areas and can be considered as a clean substitution fuel instead of fossil fuels. The photovoltaic water pumping system is one of the best alternative irrigation methods. This article presents a procedure for estimating the appropriate size of a photovoltaic system designed to power a pumping system for four irrigation methods (surface, sprinkler, drip, and developed surface irrigation) under different climate conditions for summer of three crops (cotton, thin corn, and soybean) and for winter of three crops (wheat, Bean and Barley). The solar simulation model estimated the hydraulic power, photovoltaic (PV) peak power, PV required area, total system costs and specific water demand according to the type of crop under different irrigation methods in three different geographical locations in Egypt at a different total dynamic head 50,100, and 200 m. As a comparison between the required water demand in several irrigation systems, it is found that the percentage of the amount of water demand per Fadden (m3/F) related to surface irrigation system for summer crops such as cotton crop was 85.7%, 79.9%, 66.7% in developed surface, sprinkler, and drip irrigation respectively. While in case of thin corn crop was 74.3%, 79.9%, 66.7% and for Soybean was 85.7%, 79.9%, 66.6%, respectively. In winter crops, the percentage of the amount of water demand per Fadden (m3/F) related to surface irrigation system for wheat crop was 85.6%, 79.9%, 66.7% and for bean crop was 85.7%, 0.79%, 66.7% and for Barley crop was 85.7%, 79.9%, 66.6% in developed surface, sprinkler, and drip irrigation respectively. ©2022 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC)},

More than 300 homes are concerned by this alternative solution that these microgrids represent. Presented data come from an experimental microgrid between 3 homes at the place called « Roche Plate », where electrical production is obtained by photovoltaic panels and storage by batteries. Local data are collected to simulate electrical systems and determine the optimal working point of energy distribution. These data concern the meteorological conditions, the electrical performance of devices and the inhabitants’ usage of appliances. A weather station placed on the solar plant gives the meteorological conditions of this enclave region. Daily loads for the three families are measured and all the data are stored for analysis. A continuous period of one year of measurements is available for the community and is shared throughout this data paper. These datasets will be completed later.

In this context, this article accounts for the technological solutions to the irrigation system powered by photovoltaic system that Tecnored has designed to supply energy for small farmers who are out of connection to the grid, contrasting their advantages, disadvantages, and installation costs, with focus on supplying electricity for a daytime irrigation system for 10 years. The study shows that, due to its modularity, ease of maintenance, long service life and low cost, as well as Chile's unique solar conditions, and the government incentives, photovoltaic technology with variable frequency inverters is the most suitable choice for small farmer far from the grid.

	abstract = {In this paper, a new application of Equilibrium Optimizer (EO) is proposed for design hybrid microgrid to feed the electricity to Dakhla, Morocco, as an isolated area. EO is selected to design the microgrid system due to its high effectiveness in determining the optimal solution in very short time. EO is presented for selecting the optimal system design which can minimize the cost, improve the system stability, and cover the load at different climate conditions. Microgrid system consists of photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT), battery, and diesel generator. The objective function treated in this paper is to minimize the net present cost (NPC), respecting several constraints such as the reliability, availability, and renewable fraction. The sensitivity analysis is conducted in two stages: Firstly, the impact of wind speed, solar radiation, interest rate, and diesel fuel on the NPC, and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is analyzed. Secondly, the influence of size variation on loss of power supply probability (LPSP) is investigated. The results obtained by EO are compared with those obtained by recent metaheuristics optimization algorithms, namely, Harris Hawks Optimizer (HHO), Artificial Electric Field Algorithm (AEFA), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Sooty Tern Optimization Algorithm (STOA). The results show that the optimal system design is achieved by the proposed EO, where renewable energy sources (PV and WT) represent 97% of the annual contribution and fast convergence characteristics are obtained by EO. The best NPC, LCOE, and LPSP are obtained via EO achieving 74327, 0.0917/kWh, and 0.0489, respectively.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Solar energy is growing rapidly in both industrial and agricultural domains because of its sustainability, low cost and fast implementation in isolated areas compared to fossil energy. However, the power produced by photovoltaic modules varies depending on the instantaneous irradiations and temperature in site besides load characteristics. Thus, Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) strategies are used to extract the maximum power from the modules. In this paper, a Modified PSO algorithm (MPSO) is used to track the MPP of a PV system under partial shading conditions. The proposed MPSO has more efficient exploration and exploitation phases compared to the traditional PSO due to its variable cooperation and self-memory parameters. MPSO is compared with a classical MPPT technique and the conventional PSO algorithm. MPSO shows superior capabilities in terms of tracking speed and efficiency. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) is emerging as a promising technique of water production in remote and isolated areas away from natural water resources. The present study describes potential of the AWH from low-humid regions under the climatic conditions of Hail city (27.64° N, 41.75° E) in Saudi Arabia. Trapezoidal prism solar still of 5-shelves is developed, where the shelves are filled with black cotton cloth bed saturated with calcium chloride solution. The solar still is opened during night hours, enabling the descant to absorb humidity from humid air (absorption process) and closed during day hours causing desorption of water under higher temperatures (regeneration process). The vapor condensates on a glass surface and is collected in a bottle. Under low-humid conditions of the Hail city, the desiccant balanced approximately at 48% saturation concentration. The water production of the device reaches 1.06 l/m2day by consuming 22.96 MJ solar energy/l of water with a cost of $0.055 per liter. The present study has demonstrated high potential of the AWH technique from low-humid regions up to 26.5%. The proposed device is standalone with promising performance, which needs neither the natural water resources nor the infrastructure. The device is suitable for remote and isolated small communities. © 2020, International Association for Mathematical Geosciences.},

	abstract = {Wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal energy are renewable energy sources known as promising alternatives for electricity generation, especially with the depletion of fossil fuels. Renewable energy sources are present, with huge quantities, free access, and without a negative impact on the environment. The electricity produced by renewable energies is gradually becoming economically and technically advantageous. In most cases, integrating a single source of renewable energy can lead to over-sizing and therefore a very expensive implementation. To remedy this, systems consisting of one or numerous renewable energy sources are adopted in order to guarantee maximum electricity production as well as practical reliability at encouraging costs. In addition, the electricity generated by renewable energy sources such as wind turbines, solar, biomass, geothermal energy … has a particular interest in isolated spaces. This chapter provides an updated literature review about Off-grid PV-Based Hybrid Renewable Energy System for electricity generation in remote areas. First, after the introduction, a presentation of the world energy situation was discussed in order to see the progress of the implementation of renewable energies on a global scale. Secondly, a section was reserved for renewable energy alternatives in order to discuss each source separately, before starting the part devoted to off-grid hybrid renewable energy structures. These structures have been examined in a large number of researches works with the aim of electrifying remote areas in several countries of the world. Finally, a detailed presentation of the main reliability, economic, and environmental performance indices is given for the evaluation of these systems. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Powering an isolated area is limited by the barriers like difficult terrains, scattered population and long distance transmission line system, etc. Even the electrified remote areas have poor quality, low availability and irregularity of power supply. This prevailed to search for other options like extending grid or using diesel generators (DG), batteries, etc., to meet the day to day needs of isolated communities. Due to environmental effects, such as greenhouse gas emission, global warming and climate change, etc., has turned our focus on green energy. The purpose of this work is to suggest the feasible hybrid green energy sources for generation of power from a different combination of green sources to fulfil the energy demands of a remote village called Sadivayal, Coimbatore in Southern India. To identify the optimal solution, this paper uses the software called hybrid optimization model for electric renewables (HOMER). The obtained solution shows the hybrid combination of solar-wind-hydro-battery is a sustainable, cost effective and environment friendly alternative source which also mitigates the CO2 emission and other greenhouse gas emissions. © 2020 - Kalpana Corporation},

	abstract = {The last half century has witnessed the increasing trend of renewable energy utilization with solar photovoltaic (PV) systems as one of the most popular option. Solar PV continues to supplement the main grid in powering both commercial establishments (mainly for reduced electricity expense) as well as residential houses in isolated areas (for basic energy requirement such as for lighting purposes). The objective of this study is to assess the available solar PV power (PPV) potential considering the effects of high temperature, dust and snow in the Asia Pacific region. The PPV potential was estimated considering the effects of the said meteorological parameters using several satellite data including shortwave radiation from Advanced Himawari Imager 8 (AHI8), MOD04 aerosol data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), precipitation rate from Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), air temperature from NCEP/DOE AMIP-II Reanalysis-2 data, and snow water equivalent (SWE) from Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). The model is validated by comparing its outputs with the measured PV power from two solar PV installations in Bangkok, Thailand and Perth, Australia. Results show that maximum PPV is estimated at 2.5 GW (cell efficiency of 17.47%) for the region with the maximum decrease in PPV estimated to be about < 2%, 22% and 100% due to high temperature (temperature coefficient of power Combining double low line 0.47%/K), dust and snow, respectively. Moreover, areas in India and Northern China were observed to experience the effects of both dust and temperature during March-April-May (MAM) season. Meanwhile, countries located in the higher latitudes were severely affected by snow while Australia by high temperature during Dec-Jan-Feb (DJF) season. The model has a mean percentage prediction error (PPE) range of 5% to18% and 7% to 23% in seasonal and monthly estimations, respectively. Outputs from this study can be used by stakeholders of solar PV in planning for small-scale or large-scale solar PV projects in the solar rich region of Asia Pacific. © 2020 Authors.},

The first scheme uses a single Solar PV power plant and a battery energy storage system (BESS). The size of the Solar PV plant and BESS is the total capacity of the current condition. The second scheme is the microgrid using four distributed solar PV power plants in their current location and capacity. The Solar PV connect among them to supply the island's load in one grid. The power quality of both microgrid schemes is examined.

	abstract = {Desalination is a technology with a high energy demand, mainly supplied by fossil sources. Therefore, solar energy is a real alternative, as it supplies virtually unlimited energy. Solar desalination could be an ideal solution for isolated areas which receive high solar irradiation per day. Solar Membrane Distillation (MD) is a developing technology particularly interesting for small supplies, isolated populations and autonomous systems. As it is a low temperature operation process, MD is very suitable for integration with thermal solar systems and/or waste heat recovery units; in contrast to other desalination technologies, only a coarse filtration of the water is required as pretreatment. However, the commercial availability is currently quite limited. This paper presents the promising 5-year experience and data analysis of a solar compact MD demonstration plant installed in the facilities of the Instituto Tecnológico de Canarias (ITC) in Playa de Pozo Izquierdo (Gran Canary Island-Spain).The unit was designed and installed at the end of 2004 as part of a co-funded FP6 DGTREN research project called 'Development of stand-alone, solar thermally driven and PV-supplied desalination systems based on innovative membrane distillation' (MEMDIS) and has been continuously tested within the FP7 EU co-funded project called 'MEmbrane DIstillation in Remote AreaS - MEDIRAS'. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, around 1.1 billion people in rural and remote areas of developing countries remain without electricity. Stand-alone projects that combine the wind and photovoltaic generation technologies as well as microgrids and individual supplies for the distribution network are an adequate strategy to reach such isolated regions. However, the design of electrification projects is complex, having to define the best combination of generation and distribution technologies, under a challenging social context and tight technoeconomic resources. In order to ease decision-making, several tools have been developed in the literature and are here reviewed, grouped into three main categories: optimization processes, aiming to minimize project costs subject to technical constraints, through exact or heuristic algorithms; multicriteria processes, using different methods to select the best among a set of predefined scenarios according to economic, technical, social, and environmental criteria; and systematized tools, that have been developed to provide user-friendly interface for their larger dissemination in different regions and contexts. Hence, this paper aims to provide researchers and practitioners an analysis of the advantages and limitations of approaches used over the last decade when addressing the designing of wind and/or photovoltaic electrification projects for extremely poor and isolated areas in developing countries, as well as some areas for further research.

This paper presents an extensive review on various issues related to Integrated Renewable Energy System (IRES) based power generation. Issues related to integration configurations, storage options, sizing methodologies and system control for energy flow management are discussed in detail. For stand-alone applications integration of renewable energy sources, performed through DC coupled, AC coupled or hybrid DC-AC coupled configurations, are studied in detail. Based on the requirement of storage duration in isolated areas, storage technology options can be selected for integrated systems. Uncertainties involved in designing an effective IRES based power generation system for isolated areas is accounted due to highly dynamic nature of availability of sources and the demand at site. Different methodologies adopted and reported in literature for sizing of the system components are presented.

That hybrid system is formed by a photovoltaic generator, battery system, diesel generator and isolated loads that are variable throughout the year. For that purpose, HOMER software was employed, so load-following and cycle-charging dispatch strategies were analysed with hourly-based data for a typical year. Results showed that load-following dispatch strategy is the best option, leading to energy productions of about 85.6% from the photovoltaic generator and 14.4% from the diesel generator. © 2019 IEEE.},

A stand-alone photovoltaic (PV)system can be particularly impactful in an isolated area where access to the grid is limited or unavailable. Because solar energy generation primarily depends on the availability of solar irradiance over time, energy management is crucial, which in turn can also satisfy user comfort and system efficiency. In this paper, we propose an energy consumption scheduling model for a residential house with a stand-alone PV system and battery. We develop a mixed-integer optimization model that uses consumption patterns and appliance priority to schedule the use of appliances. We test our model under four scenarios based on region and season. The results demonstrate that the proposed model provides optimal schedules for operating the appliances. In addition, we conduct a sensitivity analysis on the PV array size and the battery capacity. We compare the optimized case with the non-optimized case. © 2019 International Solar Energy Society},

For isolated areas where grid infrastructure is not possible, integration of these resources is economically and technically advantageous.

The integrated model consists of available energy resources in the vicinity such as Micro-hydro power (MHP), Biomass energy system (BES), Solar photovoltaic system (SPV) and Wind energy system (WES) in order to fulfill the total energy demand of the area. To know the utilization of different renewable energy resource a factor introduced which is known as utilization factor. The value of utilization calculated by using different optimization methods (Fmincon, GA, hybrid) for a microgrid model. Comparative analysis of different optimization technique suggest that results obtained using hybrid optimization technique is better than GA and Fmincon. Further, the feasibility study of developed microgrid model is investigated by introducing a factor optimum power delivery factor (OPDF). This factor varies from 1.0 to 0.25 considering the intermittency of available renewable resources. Studies suggest that OPDF in the range of 1.0-0.75 provide feasible solution of energy demand and beyond this it is infeasible. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The use of renewable energy is growing significantly around the world. In front of the growing demand for electricity principally for the remote and isolated areas, photovoltaic systems, especially water pumping systems, begin to find great applications. Unfortunately, these systems have faced a number of problems even nowadays: a problem of maintenance and repair. Augmented Reality (short: AR) seems to be a powerful promising technology that can answer to the problem related to the maintenance of photovoltaic pumping systems The introduction of e-maintenance can reduce cost and provide fast and easy access to relevant information for the worker by freeing distance constraints. In this paper, a distributed e-maintenance platform based on AR benefits for photovoltaic pumping system is proposed. The distributed aspect of this system will allow the remote collaboration between a remote expert and a worker. Two main aspects are studied and developed. The first aspect addresses a new collaboration strategy based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). The second aspect ensures the virtual objects transfer from the remote expert in real time. Experimental results are conducted in a first time in a mini solar station to show the feasibility of the approach. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {From the last few decades the world has become more anxious about severe climate change. So the interest on clean energy is increasing tremendously. In Bangladesh power crisis is a regular and acute problem. There are many isolated areas and islands where no electricity have been reached yet. To abate the severe energy problem wind and solar energy has good prospects. Bangladesh is situated between 20.30 and 26.38 degrees north latitude and 88.04 and 92.44 degrees east which is an ideal location for solar energy utilization and It's long costal line is suitable for wind energy as it is caused because of the bumpy heating of the atmosphere by the sun and revolving earth. In this paper, we have proposed a Hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) based on Wind turbine and PV module which is capable of meeting 50% of Sandwip's load. We checked the possibility of meeting this demand by simulating this system by creating a prototypical in HOMER simulation software. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The increasing demand for bandwidth with predictions of up to 1000 times more data required from 2010 to 2020 and a continuous growth expected from 2020 to 2030, according to the ITU, of video and M2M traffic, has been the definitively impulse for the changes in the satellite communication industry. The role of the Satcom in 5G and in the internet of things is beyond the classical satellite usages and customers. The Satcom plays a key role by extending the coverage of the terrestrial networks, providing connection for maritime, aircrafts and isolated areas; relieving the traffic congestion and providing added resilience for critical applications. The revolution in the satellite communication industry has become evident in the past few years. We are witnessing a raise of new constellations such as O3B or OneWeb, the renovation of the Iridium fleet, etc. Meanwhile in the ground segment, manufacturers of equipments are competing to deliver more efficient modulations supported by cheaper, smaller and easier to deploy units. If we look at the geostationary orbit, the satellites operators are struggling to offer higher throughput and improved adaptive solutions to reduce the cost per bit. In addition, the innovations in satellite platforms with more precise AOCS, and more capacity of batteries and solar cells, 3D printout circuits and also with the massive production of small satellites using assembly-line-based manufacturing processes such as OneWeb and the availability of new commercial launchers will definitively and completely change the commercial space industry. Many solutions have been tested in the past few years to enhance flexibility of the satellite communications, in particular in the traditional geostationary orbit. A flexible payload can be reconfigured in several ways as for example by modifying the coverage areas, each transponder power or the frequency and bandwidth of each channel, being the recent Quantum satellite (an ESA’s ARTES program) a good example. A payload that fulfils the three adaptive capacities (coverage, channel power and channel frequency plus bandwidth) shall allow the satellites operators to completely redefine the mission once in orbit either to adapt it to a changing demand or in case of moving the satellite to a different orbital slot. In classical missions the payload requirements are already almost fixed a few years before the launch and remains fixed during 15 years or even more while in-orbit. The payload is designed to provide the specified service in a designated area and therefore the main tasks of the satellite operators, as far as the payload operations are concerned, consist in dealing with interferences sources, meteorology events and satellite components aging, solar panels and TWTAs, which shall require eventually increasing/decreasing the operational point of the transponders or switching to a spare unit in case of failure of a nominal one and, if the payload support this, changing the uplink to downlink connectivity. Flexible payloads include the dynamic modification in the transmission plan in response to users changing demands as a new variable in regular operations, which shall have a great impact in the way payload operations need to be handled driving the need of automation with support for managing the interactions among the payload subsystems. Another concept that changes completely from fixed missions to flexible ones is the spare unit management. This, being a basic concept when designing, building and operating the fixed payload, fades away in the flexible payloads where no units are designed as spare equipment. This paper focus on the changes in payload operation concepts from traditional geostationary missions to flexible payload ones and the ground systems required to efficiently operate a flexible payload maximizing the provided capacity. Main requirements for an in-flight mission design, link budget and payload management tool are exposed, and finally, GMV smart payload suite is introduced as a possible solution focusing on how to fulfil the presented requirements and a possible evolution of the suite for carrier monitoring using the capabilities of a flexible payload. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

	abstract = {Renewable energy offers convenient energy solution to the population living in isolated areas. The residents can utilize the locally available energy resources for fulfilling their need for electricity. The availability of electricity in the darkness of night facilitates higher productivity. In this paper, design of a solar PV-diesel mini-grid system has been presented for a locality in Char Parbotipur (25.75°N 89.66°E). This island is situated 20 km north-east from Kurigram district, Bangladesh and surrounded by Brahmaputra river and Dudhkumar river, far from the national grid. Very few residents use stand-alone Solar Home Systems (SHS) and diesel generators. Diesel generators have environmental concern which can be minimized by using hybrid renewable energy systems. This paper aims at designing an optimal energy system consisting solar PV having diesel generator for fulfilling the load demand. The proposed energy system can generate electricity at a cost of $0.461/kWh for a load of 115 kWh/day. Sensitivity analysis is presented to understand the effect of diesel price and solar irradiation on the cost of electricity and net present cost of the system. Comparison between the proposed hybrid renewable energy system and an energy system comprising diesel generator only are also presented to understand the effect of solar PV integration with diesel generators for environmental benefits. The solar PV-diesel energy system emits 53.68% lower CO2 as compared to diesel generator.},

In islands, power generation is mainly done with diesel generators, but the high costs and energy spent on transporting fuel and the CO2 emissions generated from its operation have been raising concerns lately. In this study, a hydrogen fueled micro-grid using solar photovoltaics and heat collectors is proposed for power generation in isolated areas. The grid consists of a central facility with a main power generation system, connected to a number of residences. An optimization model is built which finds the size and component capacities of the micro-grid at which hydrogen consumption per household is minimized. The model is run using energy demands and irradiation data from the areas of Kansai and Kyushu, Japan. The model was able to find the trends at which hydrogen consumption can be minimized. Primary energy consumption by the grid showed high savings compared to the conventional system. Potential sources of hydrogen fuel for the proposed grid are discussed as well.},

	abstract = {Electricity production by solar energy can reduce the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) which is a big environmental concern around the globe especially in the countries like Bangladesh. Bangladesh is a small country in South Asia with a huge population. The country has many isolated areas that are not connected to the national grid. People living in those off-grid areas mainly use diesel generators that emit GHGs into the atmosphere contributing to global warming. Electricity production using solar energy can be an attractive alternative from economic and environmental perspective. The present study attempts to conduct a techno-economic assessment by developing a bottom-up data-intensive spread-sheet-based model. The model estimates the unit cost of electricity generated by a 3.40 kWp stand-alone solar photovoltaic system (PV) for an isolated locality in Char Godagari, Rajshahi. The island has geographical coordinates of 24°28'6"N and 88°19'25"E and is situated in Rajshahi district. The unit cost of electricity by solar energy was found to be $0.72/kWh or 55.47 Bangladeshi Taka (BDT)/kWh with a net present cost of $12,027.83 or BDT 926,142.55 for the selected location, Char Godagari. The results show that battery is the most expensive component of the solar PV system. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to see the impact of various input parameters on the unit cost of electricity.},

The Institute of Planning and Promotion of Energy Solutions (IPSE) conducted this project for noninterconnected zones under the Ministry of Mines and Energy of Colombia. This project targets two main objectives: To increase the hours of electricity supply to the population and reduce the hours of use of diesel plants. This project allows for the production of electricity from solar radiation through "preinstalled solar trackers - 100kWp installed power" and a new solar farm which supplies 220kWp, plus a battery room with 480 cells and installed capacity storage 3,148kWh. Finally, the facility has been supported by two 308kW diesel plants. This paper presents the largest PV system isolated from Colombia so far. First, we make a geographical description of the area of project implementation, also an approach to the indigenous community, their customs and their social and technological issues. Likewise, the paper presents some of the challenges and difficulties of setting up the project in an isolated area of difficult access and complex environmental conditions. In addition, the stages of assembly and some technical details of installation are presented, highlighting the design features and implementation with respect to civil works, electrical works and the main characteristics of the photovoltaic system in terms of panels, batteries and system integration. © 2015 WIT Press.},

This is true for areas that receive high averages of solar radiation annually. Using microturbine as a standby source will make utilization of hybrid systems more attractive. A sizing optimization of the hybrid system components, an economic feasibility study and a complete design of the hybrid system consisting of photovoltaic (PV) panels, a microturbine as a backup power source and a battery system supplying a small community in a tropical climate area were presented in this paper. A scenario depending on PV standalone and another scenario depending on microturbine alone were also studied and analyzed in this paper. This is to select the most appropriate considering cost and pollutant emissions for these areas. A simulation program depending on an iterative approach was used to optimize the sizes of PV system and battery bank. Specifications of the hybrid system components are then determined according to the optimized values. Solar radiation data is firstly analyzed and the tilted angle of the PV panels is also optimized. It is found that electrifying rural small community using this hybrid system is very beneficial and competitive with other types of conventional sources as it decreases both operating costs and pollutant emissions. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Communities in the high-altitude region of the Peruvian Southern Andean Mountains are located over 4200 meters above sea level. Communities organize in isolated cabins dispersed in an extensive area surrounding the community center. The harsh natural environment and poor living conditions affect people's health and increase child mortality, especially in winter. Daytime solar radiation is of high intensity. At night exterior temperatures are-10 C, while indoor temperatures of cabins barely reach 0 C. This research sought to improve the thermal performance of these cabins with passive design strategies and local resources. The methodology included: a) collection of weather data versus indoor thermal performance, availability of local resources and understanding domestic organization patterns; b) definition of comfort temperature range and analysis of local materials; c) technology transfer by involving the population in the construction of a prototype. Simple passive strategies of air tightness and solar gain with local available materials (adobe for walls, totora reed (Schoenoplectus tatora) and sheep wool for insulation, and stone and wood to waterproof the floor) improved night thermal performance in these isolated areas. Although local people are starting to implement these techniques in their own cabins, this is just the starting point towards appropriate thermal comfort. © Copyright 2017 NCEUB.},

Clean and renewable production systems is gaining incentive to search for pieces of institutions and the government, especially the sources like the sun and the wind. There are plenty of both sources throughout the Brazilian territory and its use becomes interesting to isolated regions due to lack of network installation that enables access to electricity. This study investigates the production of energy from a hybrid system composed of photovoltaic panels and a wind turbine. These systems are adequate to meet the energy needs of isolated areas due to the high cost of electrification places with low demand and difficult to access. The project was developed at the Center of Alternative Energy and Renewable-NEAR Rural Energizing Laboratory of the Department of UNESP Rural Engineering, Faculty Agricultural Sciences, Lageado Experimental Farm, located in Botucatu, São Paulo, Brazil, which was used three photovoltaic I-100 Isofoton with nominal power of 100Wp each, for a total installed 300Wp and a wind turbine AIR X-rural model SOUTHWEST WINDPOWER with nominal power of 400 W, which was obtained for a year energy production data using this system. In general, energy production ranged from 34.8 to 209 watts hybrid photovoltaic system and the wind. It was possible to observe the complementary mode of energy production systems analyzed, since the photovoltaic panels have higher yield during the day, while the wind turbine has energy production at night. © 2003-2012 IEEE.},

Based on these problems, it is cleared that an electricity system is required for long-term solutions so that it can enhance the role of new and renewable energy, improve the electricity reliability and reduce the energy costs. Efficiency and effectiveness is expected to increase the sustainable electricity supply for remote and isolated area in Madura island by utilizing the available resources like potential solar energy as a new and renewable energy. The development of photovoltaic power plant is a fast and independent solution because the access and infrastructure in Madura island doesn't support yet for the conventional electrical facilities. System dynamics method is used to analyse the system by creating a scenario model to identify any factors and variables which affect the system. As the result of the scenario model, total demand for electricity supply in the 58 remote villages in Pamekasan is 24,935 MW, which cost Rp 632.812.500.000,- for the photovoltaic power plant investment. To complete the analysis feasibility in order to meet the fulfilment, it is also considered economics aspect with Payback Period, which is need 25 years to return the investment in optimistic scenario. © 2018 The Authors.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to find the optimum tilt angle of solar PV panel at which the yearly demand would be met maximum. Solar PV is one of the most widely used renewable energy resources. The output of a panel is highest when the incident ray is perpendicular to the panel plane. Due to variations in the locus of the sun over the year, the alignment of the panel should be changed according to the sun position for maximum generation. However, changing the tilt angle needs single axis tracker or double axes tracker which is costly and also needs maintenance; thus may not be suitable. Therefore, the panel is kept at the average tilt of year at which the ray is perpendicular for the maximum time. This may be termed as the default tilt angle. The generation of solar panel varies over the year providing maximum generation at the default tilt angle. Similarly, the consumption of an area is also varies over the year. The amount of generation may not proportional as the demand, thus it results surplus or shortage. For an isolated area, it is hardly possible to use surplus energy considering certain demand profile. Even, it is not possible to store the surplus energy of a season to any device for long time to use it for another season. However, the surplus energy of a season may be shifted to the shortage season by changing the tilt angle. Different tilt angle will provide different pattern of generation over the year. The generation at optimum tilt angle will not maximize the generation of energy over the year rather it will maximize the demand met by shifting the energy to shortage season from surplus season. A new concept to maximize the energy usage from solar PV by changing the tilt angle and thus minimize the shortage to meet the demand of an isolated power system is also introduced here. © 2015 IEEE.},

Results show that the usage of battery storage is economically crucial, particularly in areas with a low daily electrical consumption and peak loads increasing in the early morning and late evening when the solar radiation is lower and PV array has a reduced power production. Results disclose that the optimal configuration of the hybrid system (PV-storage-diesel generators), despite its high investment cost, presents an economic benefit of 25.5 and 22.2% compared to the usage of only PV array and diesel generators and only diesel generators and a reduction of fuel consumption equal to 74.7 and 77%, respectively. © 2017 The Authors.},

The project's main objective is to provide a compact, mobile, flexible, easy-to-assemble system with low maintenance costs and an independent power supply, that provides high-quality water from surface water sources in isolated areas. The plant was designed with nine filters to eliminate any pathogens that may be found in the source water. The disinfection system uses a UV reactor. The support structures were digitally simulated to optimize spaces, while the power supply uses a stand-alone photovoltaic system. To validate the results, water quality tests were performed in an INACAL-accredited laboratory, according to the Water Quality for Human Consumption Regulations contained in DS 031-2010-SA, as well as product testing with consumers.

	abstract = {Electrical energy supply in isolated areas is still a challenging issue faced now. Electrical energy sources such as solar, hydro, and wind are energy that can be developed to be alternative energy sources in remote areas, especially in rural areas. Photovoltaic (PV) is one source of energy that can be used to supply energy needs in rural areas. PV has the maximum point of power affected by temperature and irradiance values. To get the maximum power, Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) is used. Generally, MPPT is only aimed to get PV maximum power value. However, in a mini grid system, the system can possibly need only a part of the power generated by PV, not all energy produced by PV. If PV still generates at the maximum power at a full battery condition, the over voltage may occur. Therefore, PV in the mini grid should be controlled by a PI-based fuzzy controller to manage the PV power generation. The proposed controller suppresses PV power output when there is excess power in the system. The system design is started by composing formulated load models based on survey data. It will be continued by determining the optimum PV value and battery storage capacity. Then, a PI-based fuzzy controller for the modified MPPT control is designed to control power produced by PV. Battery SOC, PV voltage and PV output current are used as fuzzy inputs. The results show that the proposed controller has better performance with no overshoot and fast response time compared to a conventional fuzzy MPPT. © 2017 IEEE.},

This algorithm is inspired by the frequency separation method. Indeed, it is based on the calculation of sliding averages using centered moving average filters, which allow simultaneous and natural processing of measurement data (past) and load and sunshine forecast (future). Moreover, this algorithm has no limits of degrees of freedom and can handle more than two sources of energy without resorting to complex problems. The algorithm is tested on a hybrid system composed of solar panels as a renewable energy source, a fuel cell as a secondary source, a battery bank and a supercapacitor bank as energy storage systems. The main aim of the proposed strategy is to minimize the total operating cost of the system while satisfying the constraints required by the energy storage systems. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed method is highly improved through the addition of an automatic correction process. The simulation results are convincing and validate the proposed energy management strategy. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A prototype system for hydrogen gas production from a biological system of facultative fermentation has been applied for electricity power supply. The prototype was designed for application in remote or isolated areas in Indonesia. The fermentation system, which was designed to be as simple as possible, includes the preparation of the microbial seed, the substrate material, the vessel and other required equipment, gas capture and purification, a converter, and transportation. The model experiment in the field undergoes several modifications depending on the biomass sources in the actual location, i.e., some areas have agroforestry, sugarcane, soy sauce and palm sugar wastes. The light intensity and temperature followed the natural conditions. The results indicated that a cultivation scale of 5-25 L per substrate does not affect the result, i.e., a hydrogen production of approximately 60-70% of the total gas produced. The hydrogen gas produced was converted into electricity sources to power fans and house lamps. However, the hydrogen power is not yet sustainable due to the batch fermentation system, the biomass supply and the local electrical system, which is conventional (not a grid system). We propose to merge the electrical system in those areas, i.e., combining the source of electrical power from wind, solar, biomass, ocean current and fossil fuel-based generators. The model of the electricity pool system is important for Indonesia because, geographically, Indonesia consists of more than seventeen thousand islands, where the electricity supply remains unstable. © 2014 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Solar energy is an effective solution to extend the use of these intelligent systems in isolated areas. In fact, this paper presents a practical solution based on the power-aware design for controlling the indoor environment of solar greenhouses. The system consists of feedback fuzzy logic controllers that log key field parameters using specific sensors and performs control actions for the environmental temperature, soil moisture, and relative humidity. With regard to the battery-coupled architecture of the solar system, the decision level is designed to consider the availability of operational resources before acting. Keeping in mind the constraint of low-cost, we propose a flexible design of an embedded system able to support remote management of the indoor environment key-parameters. The proposed control system was validated experimentally. The efficiency of the system was assessed by demonstrating significant energy and water savings as well as protection of solar system components from dry running issues. © 2019 The Authors.},

	abstract = {In water distribution networks, water is often fed under gravity from a higher reservoir to another reservoir at a lower level. The residual pressure head at the receiving reservoir is then dissipated through control valves (mechanically or hydraulically actuated), sometimes augmented by orifice plates where there is a propensity for cavitation. There are possibilities to add turbines in parallel and generate hydroelectricity at these locations using the flow and head available. The benefit of this hydropower generating application is that minimal civil works need to be done, as the control valves are normally inside a control room/valve chamber. No negative environmental or social effects require mitigation, and the anticipated lead times should be short. From a topographical perspective the City of Tshwane has a lower elevation than the bulk service reservoirs of Rand Water, which is the main water supply. Water is distributed through a large water system that includes 160 reservoirs, 42 water towers, 10 677 km of pipes and more than 260 pressure reducing stations (PRS) that operate at pressures of up to 250 m. The top ten hydropower potential sites in the City of Tshwane water distribution network have a total energy generating capacity of approximately 10 000 MWh/a. A number of potential conduit-hydropower sites have shown promise of short payback periods. The identifying and development of these sites in Tshwane to convert water pressure to electricity is ongoing and exploited further. Various challenges currently exist with reservoir communication in isolated areas due to vandalism and theft of necessary infrastructure, including electricity cables and solar panels. Because conduit-hydropower systems can be housed completely inside chambers, vandalism and theft can be mitigated. Therefore, one of the major benefits of hydropower turbines at these sites is that the hydroelectric potential could be exploited to power telemetry, pressure management, flow control and monitoring/security systems. Alternatively or additionally, other local demand and/or (depending upon the quantum of energy available) off-site energy demand clusters, or even a municipal or national grid, could also be serviced by these power stations. The capacity of hydroelectric installations can vary to suit the application for the amount of power needed or to be generated. Short payback periods, especially when using pumps as turbines, also make conduit-hydropower systems attractive. © 2014, South African Institute of Civil Engineers. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Today, most of the electricity generated comes from fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas). These fossil fuels have finite reserves and will run out in the future. The negative effect of these fossil fuels is that they produce pollutant gases when they are burned in the process to generate electricity. Fossil fuels are a non-renewable energy source. However, renewable energy resources (solar, wind, hydro, biomass, geothermal and ocean) are constantly replaced, hence will not run out, and are usually less polluting. Due to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions more attention is being given to renewable energy. As wind is a renewable energy it is a clean and abundant resource that can produce electricity with virtually no pollutant gas emission. Induction generators are widely used for wind powered electric generation, especially in remote and isolated areas, because they do not need an external power supply to produce the excitation magnetic field. Furthermore, induction generators have more advantages such as cost, reduced maintenance, rugged and simple construction, brushless rotor (squirrel cage) and so on.

	abstract = {Providing energy to areas isolated from the electricity grid through the use of a smart integrated renewable energy system (SIRES) is proposed in this study for Valparaiso, Chile. The study analyzes the process of identifying the appropriate size of a SIRES considering technical and economic factors. An optimization model proposed in the literature was modified, and a subsequent spatial-temporal analysis of the different variables was conducted. The model comprises locally available renewable energy resources, such as biomass, biogas, wind power, solar photovoltaic, and thermal power. Furthermore, it was used to determine the energy potential of each of the isolated areas, identifying those areas in which the SIRES could be implemented as a sustainable solution. The design simulates the cost of the initial investment and energy generation in the chosen areas. The study also includes the selection of different system components and the use of the general model to determine the optimal combination of energy subsystems for isolated areas with the aim of minimizing the cost of energy generations. Finally, an economic evaluation showed that the use of a SIRES based mainly on solar energy supported by biomass, biogas, and mini-wind power costs approximately three times less than extending the electricity grid network. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The renewable energy sources (RES) are globally recognized as a suitable option for sustainable development in many off-grid applications. Recently, the integrated systems with two or more RES are being paid great attention for electrification of isolated areas and found to be an acceptable solution rather than uneconomical grid extension. In the present study, the integrated renewable energy system (IRES) model is developed using solar, wind, biomass and biogas energy sources to meet the electricity demand of the isolated rural community of Khatisitara village of Gujarat state in India. The operational strategy of IRES model is developed considering the distribution network losses as a system design parameter. The developed IRES model is optimized for minimum net present cost of the system using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm in MATLAB environment. The well-established genetic algorithm (GA) was used to validate the optimization results obtained from PSO. Further, the effects of distribution losses (DL) on the system sizing, reliability and economy have been evaluated. The sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effect of economically influencing parameters on the developed model. Finally, the break-even analysis was performed for the grid extension distance to examine the economic feasibility of IRES against grid extension. The simulation result shows that the impacts of DL on IRES reliability and economy are significant. Further analysis shows that the IRES using locally available renewable energy sources is a feasible option for rural electrification in considered study area rather than grid extension. © International Journal Of Renewable Energy Research, 2018.},

As DC systems can be designed for specific loads. In this paper, we focus on increasing the efficiency of a DC nanogrid by reducing the switching losses. We achieved this by using a soft switching technique that is ZCS. The benefit of this technique are, the reduction in the size of the system and good results even at higher switching frequency.

	abstract = {A large segment of the world's population lives in rural areas that are geographically isolated, remote and sparsely populated. Nano grids employing hybrid energy systems (HES) based on photovoltaics (PV) and wind farms are considered to be an effective option to electrify remote and isolated areas which are far from conventional grids. This is applicable to areas that receive high averages of solar radiation and sufficient average wind speed annually. In this research investigation, a DC nano-grid was modelled, simulated and optimized for a hybrid solar-PV and wind, with energy storage and a back-up diesel generator for Umzinyathi district in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. A site survey was conducted, wind resource and solar radiation data obtained for the purpose of load forecasting and system modelling. HOMER software was used for system modelling. Minimum cost optimization of the system was carried out taking into consideration the costs of system components, hourly solar radiation and rating parameters as inputs into the simulation program. Sensitivity variables were specified to examine the effect of their uncertainties on system performance. Based on simulation results, the optimal system comprises of a 100kW PV array, thirteen 7.5kW wind turbines, 20kW diesel generator, and 96 Trojan T-105 deep cycle batteries. The net present cost (NPC), cost of energy (CoE) and payback period of the optimal system were found to be 459 545, 0.248/kWh and 4 years respectively. The economic and environmental analysis indicated that it is more advisable to electrify remote settlements using a DC nano-grid based on hybrid systems with multiple renewable sources as they have lower operating costs and more environmental friendly due to the reduced dependence on diesel generating units. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Solar and wind energy are considered as promising electrical generating sources. These renewable energies are omnipresent, with free access, and a friendly environmental impact. Their integration remains technically and economically advantageous for electrical generation in isolated areas (IS). In several cases, the separate use of solar and wind energy sources may result in considerable over-sizing, which makes the single renewable energy sources in implementation very costly. It is found that the use of one of the optimization sizing techniques could help to guarantee the maximum power reliability and the minimum system cost for the future hybrid implementation. Moreover, a remarkable interest is manifesting for the use of solar and wind renewable energy sources (RES), which provide a realistic form of electrical generation in isolated areas. This paper provides an updated literature review, of the most applied method and techniques used in sizing and optimization of PV-Wind based hybrid system (PWHS) for an isolated area aiming to reach the best compromise between power reliability and hybrid system costs. Furthermore, this work discusses a comparison of the most common topologies used for the implementation of PWHS, then, presents a mathematical model of the hybrid system components with an emphasis on the importance of power reliability and system cost, Finally, provides an extensive analysis of software tools and algorithm approach used in sizing optimization. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Renewable energy sources have significant advantages both from the environmental and the economic point of view. Additionally, renewable energy sources can contribute significantly to the development of isolated areas that currently have no connection to the electricity supply network. In order to make efficient use of these energy sources, it is necessary to develop appropriate energy management strategies. This work presents an energy management strategy for an isolated hybrid renewable energy system with hydrogen production from bioethanol reforming. The system is based on wind-solar energy, batteries and a bioethanol reformer, which produces hydrogen to feed a fuel cell system. Bioethanol can contribute to the development of isolated areas with surplus agricultural production, which can be used to produce bioethanol. The energy management strategy takes the form of a state machine and tries to maximize autonomy time while minimizing recharging time. The proposed rule-based strategy has been validated both by simulation and experimentally in a scale laboratory station. Both tests have shown the viability of the proposed strategy complying with the specifications imposed and a good agreement between experimental and simulation results.  2018 by the authors.},

Conventional methods face problems regarding its affordability. Renewable energy based power system is possible option for the electrification of these villages. This is challenge in front of researchers to regulate the output power to cope with load demand, as RES are whether dependent with varying daily and seasonal patterns. Combining the renewable energy generation with energy storage bank & ac power from substation will enable the power generated from a renewable energy sources to be more reliable, affordable and used more efficiently.

	abstract = {Growing Solar Photovoltaic (PV) electricity systems in geographically diverse regions presents a complex policy problem for governments. During 2013-16, the Queensland government in Australia, examined establishing a fair and reasonable retail Feed-in Tariff (FiT) policy, noting it regulates state retail electricity consumption prices. A combined cost avoidance and stakeholder analysis was applied to show that determination of a fair and reasonable FiT for all stakeholders, while aspirational, is difficult to achieve. Typically, agreement on a fair tariff rate will depend on stakeholders’ relative position in energy supply chains (service providers, retailers, suppliers, customers, advocates), and interpretations of fairness that can be shaped by competition in the supply area. Also, increases in financial benefits to PV customers might be considered unreasonable by non-PV customers and retailers that experience increases in electricity prices and operating costs. Importantly, the application of a retail FiT in regional and isolated areas requires careful energy policy design, taking account of network losses, remote and isolated customer metering, cost effective network control technologies, and diesel generator operating limits. The study also observed that shifting funding of FiT schemes from electricity distributors to competitive retailers will likely have negative consequences for retail FiT offerings and PV customer servicing. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {There are many remote villages in Malaysia that are not connected to an electric grid, and are dependent on expensive diesel generator sets (gensets) in their daily activities. Malaysia, a tropical country, has the potential to promote solar power generation in these isolated areas. The organic Rankine cycle (ORC) using solar thermal energy as the heat source could be an attractive approach to off-grid power generation. In this study, a 1 kWe solar ORC with a parabolic trough collector (PTC) is proposed. The ORC utilizes R245fa as the working fluid and Therminol VP1 as the heat transfer medium between the PTC and ORC. Thermodynamic analysis of the ORC is performed, predicting the performance of the ORC and the operating conditions of the PTC. Based on the design requirements of the PTC from the power cycle analysis, process of sizing the PTC is conducted via a numerical model. Seven sets of heat collector elements (HCE) are examined. The effects of absorber tube material, selective coating on the outer surface of the absorber tube, and the absorber tube diameter on the PTC performance are presented. Simulation results show that HCE with 6 mm of SS316L absorber tube, enclosed with 11 mm of Pyrex borosilicate glass tube, has the highest collector efficiency of 62.25%. The receiver length required is 8.05 m and the aperture width of the collector is 3.54 m. Further study is recommended to select a thermal storage system for night-time operation of the ORC. © 2019 Penerbit UTM Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a PV–powered water pumping system for rural or remote areas an alternate to grid powered water pump system. The three-phase induction motor could be a prevailing solution for the existing dc motor water pumping system since the cost of the system is high. The controller for a photovoltaic powered induction motor water pumping system without using any battery or any chemical charge/storage element is presented. Proposed system has a modified Two-Inductor Boost Converter (TIBC), analog circuit based MPPT, and a full-bridge three-phase Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) connected to induction motor and pump. The modified TIBC topology has features like high voltage gain, low input current ripple, with further improvement on the use of maximum power point technique (MPPT) algorithm for the efficient utilization of available solar power. The system also achieves a more competent, consistent, maintenance-free and an low-priced solution for ac motors. An algorithmic rule supporting power-seeking controller adjusts the motor speed position to realize the MPPT operation of the photovoltaic array. As a result, the system may be a promising key to be employed in isolated locations, to deliver water in remote/isolated areas. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

	abstract = {Desalination of brackish groundwater has emerged as a major option to overcome water scarcity, since quantity and quality of surface water is not appropriate for the continuously growing water demand of two-thirds of the world’s population. Photovoltaic (PV) solar energy powered reverse osmosis (RO) system can be the best option in secluded and isolated areas of the world that are suffering from a shortage of electricity energy and drinking water. This technique is likely to be the lowest energy demanding technology among other desalination techniques. Further, adopting measures like energy recovery devices, hybrid pretreatment process, and battery-less system reduces overall cost of the system. But, the capital cost of the system is still too high to support this technology competitively in the market. In the present paper, a review of the PV-RO systems employed for drinking water treatment in non-electrified rural areas of developing countries has been provided. The status of development in the last few years, along with the attempts towards finding rational solutions for cost reduction are also summarized. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The role of the MPPT is to force the system for working at the maximum point for each change of the illumination or the temperature. We present in first the classical technique, by explaining how we can obtain the maximum power under a variable meteorological condition. In P&O strategy, for big value of disturbance step we can get quickly the desired point but with a large oscillation. Small value of disturbance step makes very slow system and affects the responding time. By using fuzzy logic technique the appropriate disturbance step is produced in order to obtain a fast system with an acceptable precession. The simulation of the photovoltaic pumping chain is constructed under Matlab/Simulink, when the effectiveness of the fuzzy MPPT strategy is shown by the obtained results, which makes its application for controlling solar panels very interesting. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {This project develops a mini-grid hybrid power system to provide reliable supply of clean water supply for rural areas and emergency relief conditions. This design process includes the mini-grid power system with desalination plant and economic analysis for the whole project life cycle. The mini-grid power supply introduces solar power as the sole power supply after considering the geographical conditions of rural areas that make it not viable to build transmission line interconnection with the existing National Grid. Currently, these remote areas are highly depending on diesel generators which the transportation cost of fuel is often unaffordable. Furthermore, natural disasters such as tsunami, flood, earthquake, typhoon and volcanic eruption usually results in isolated areas which creates plenty of opportunities for renewable energy applications in emergency relief conditions where the massive destruction of infrastructures for power and clean water supply usually took place. The design scenario of mini-grid power system will be utilising solar and batteries as the energy storage system. This mini-grid power system will be supplying reliable power supply for desalination plant to provide clean water supply. The economic issues that will be considered are the initial capital cost invested, the total net present cost (NPC), the cost of electricity (COE) generated by the system per kWh and the simple payback time (SPBT) for the project. In addition, this project will support the renewable energy applications to reduce the green house gas (GHG) emission as following Malaysia's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emission intensity by 40% by 2020. The simulation studies will be based on an actual set of conditions in a remote area in Pulau Tuba, Langkawi using HOMER.

However generations with renewable energy resources cannot meet the demand of loads securely.

	abstract = {Autonomous photovoltaic systems have already been proved as one of the most reliable ways to handle the electrification requirements of remote consumers in isolated areas. The technology improvement in the field of building integrated photovoltaic systems, along with the governmental financial incentives for boosting the corresponding energy sector, have increased the interest of installing small scale photovoltaic systems not only in remote dwellings but also in grid-connected households. The penetration of photovoltaic systems in densely populated areas has made people even more familiar with them and therefore people with environmental consciousness are more likely to adopt the specific technology. In this context, the present work aims in highlighting the capabilities of building integrated photovoltaic systems along with battery storage devices in covering the electrical needs of a typical dwelling using real electricity demand and meteorological data based on Typical Meteorological Year time series. The system is simulated on an hourly basis by using an integrated numerical code that has been developed by the Soft Energy Applications & Environmental Protection Laboratory of the Mechanical Engineering Dept. of Piraeus University of Applied Sciences in Greece.

	abstract = {Algeria is in a region with an enormous potential of solar energy for power generation. However, photovoltaic (PV) power plants have not yet been developed sufficiently in the country, and its applications such as PV pumping, solar distillation, and solar heating. The main problem is the high maintenance, operating costs, fossil-fuel transportation, and CO2 emission of Bordj Badji Mokhtar's (BBM's) diesel power plant that exhibits a noteworthy issue in south Algeria. This paper presents the results of a theoretical and experimental study for PV/diesel hybrid energy system (HES) considering the load demand profile and the solar radiation in isolated area of south Algeria. Suggested hybridization based on a renewable energy with a view to an improved environment is promising. Study results show the performance of PV/diesel system based on solar radiation. The experiment load curve in this typical area may conduct the diesel generator to operate at 60% to 70% of its nominal power with less fuel consumption, and it has been verified during this study that the implementation of a PV/diesel hybrid system is efficient for higher load and higher solar radiation. Results and discussions are encouraging considering less emission of greenhouse gases and less storage of fuel, which drives the government to draw a political arrangement for the improvement of cleaner forms of electricity generation. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Fuzzy logic is a mathematical system where something can be represented in continuous values between 0 and 1. It basically represents systems based on human reasoning. The hardware comprises of four components – the switched mode power supply, the source switching circuit, buck-boost converter and the diversion load controller. The pre-testing conducted based on the methodology indicates that the proposed charge controller is efficient in maximizing the input power that enters the charge controller under different conditions. The current efficiency rate of the charge controller is 96.02%.

	abstract = {Smart home systems were introduced to autonomously control appliances, lights and other services based on the current state inside homes. Smart home systems are designed for a wide band of applications such as healthcare, power management, safety and security. In Egypt, we are suffering from an electrical power shortage because the production is not sufficient for the actual consumption. In addition, there are some isolated areas not covered by the National Grid. Because of this persisting challenge, the need for finding solutions arose. Egypt is a developing country with limited resources, consequently economic and power saving focused solutions are needed. In this paper, a simple integrated design of a smart green house is introduced as a solution for a common Egyptian home to save the consumed power from the National Grid. This design has two main pillars: First, a smart system that controls the power consumption through monitoring the activity in the home to save the power as much as possible. This system comprises of a wireless network of controllers. Each controller monitors and controls a specific area considered a separate zone. These zone controllers exchange the current data and control parameters with a master unit, which provides supervision and control of the entire system. In addition, the system can be monitored and configured locally through a wall mounted touch screen or remotely using a mobile phone or web interface. Second, a solar power supply system equipped with a two degree of freedom sun tracker to partially or fully power the loads and hence reduces the power consumption from the National Grid. The solar system is integrated with the smart supervision system through a wireless link to the master unit. © 2017 IEEE.},

But the amount of power available from these natural resources will vary continuously from place to place and time to time depending on its geographical locations, terrains, altitude, climatic conditions. So the energy supplied from these sources will be fluctuating in nature. Hybrid energy system is an excellent option for supplying small isolated power systems (SIPS) and remote villages where conventional grid cannot reach due to technical and economical reasons. The report discusses hybrid energy systems. The reliability of supply is the major concern in the performance evaluation of hybrid energy systems. Several methods for evaluating reliability evaluation have been explained in this report. The present dissertation analyses the reliability of a typical hybrid energy system consisting of a solar PV system in conjunction with a diesel generating set to supply an isolated area. In this context, it must be understood that different reliability assessment methods have their own limitation.},

	abstract = {The collector accuracy requirements for parabolic trough systems are a function of the concentrator and receiver geometry. As the current trend is to use larger trough designs the need for higher accuracy is generally more important. Concentrating solar power (CSP) companies developing and deploying collectors need to meet stringent optical performance requirements and thus require accurate surface characterization instruments to validate that performance. All reflective characterization processes are sensitive to the instrument resolution, experimental setup, data fitting process, and analysis. Small changes in any of these factors can impact the estimated optical performance. It is desirable to have total local surface measurement uncertainties less than 0.5 milliradians (mrad) for a parabolic trough reflector and many instruments are capable of achieving this. Most surface characterization instruments perform a fitting process on measured data that yields a best fit description of the collector surface using some sort of polynomial. Because of this relationship it is desirable to have a robust fitting process. The type and order of the fitted polynomial and fitting process are the two major contributors to describing a facet's surface based on the measured data. The order of the polynomial can increase or decrease the accuracy of surface description relative to the true surface. This is a function of the existing aberrations in the facet and the surface naturally described by the polynomial. An accurate description of a surface is typically obtained by performing a least squares fit on measured surface data relative to the polynomial. The best analytical description of the surface is achieved when residual errors relative to the polynomial are minimized. The difference between measured data and the best fit description is completed using an iterative process. However, not all surface imperfections on a single reflector can be accurately described with a polynomial as an exact mathematical description of the surface can never be truly achieved. Local positional errors exist in isolated areas of a facet cannot always be fit accurately. The sensitivity in the best fit description of the surface and the surface resulting from the fitting process using higher order polynomials will be discussed in this paper. The change in calculated facet location and surface slope are compared to determine the sensitivity of the process. The results are then used to calculate the intercept factor using ray tracing and estimate the sensitivity in this calculated performance metric. Copyright © 2012 by ASME.},

The analysis is addressed from energy, economic and environmental perspective. A specific application for Argentina in which fourteen locations are analyzed is considered. Results show that solar concentration technologies can be an economically and environmentally viable alternative. Levelized cost of energy (LCOE) ranges between 2.5 and 16.9 c€/kWh/m2 and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions avoided range between 33 and 348 kgCO2/(m2·year). CPC technology stands out as the most recommendable technology when the working fluid temperature ranges from 373 K to 423 K. As the working fluid temperature increases the differences between the LCOE values of the CPC and LFC technologies decrease. When 523 K is reached LFC technology is the one which presents the lowest LCOE values for all analyzed sites, while the LCOE values of PTC technology are close to CPC technology values. Results show that solar concentration technologies have reached economic and environmental competitiveness levels under certain scenarios, mainly linked to solar resource available, thermal level requirements and solar technology cost. © 2017 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In developing countries there are a large number of isolated areas not connected to the main grid. The energy demands of these remote, isolated communities are met by diesel operated power systems. These systems are often highly polluting and with time, an effort is made to make a transition to systems wherein single or multiple renewable energy sources are used to augment the diesel generators and thereby reduce the environmental footprint. Majority of such off-grid hybrid systems include a massive battery bank to store excess energy to supply the user when the renewable is inefficient. Inclusion of such large batteries results in additional investment costs and recycling issues. Therefore it is necessary to minimise the battery size as far as possible, and operate the system under a strategy to ensure maximum utilisation of renewable supplies and minimal DG usage. In this paper the power management strategy for a PV-battery and VSDG system was developed. A battery was modelled in MATLAB and four different battery operation algorithms were simulated for a set of data comprising of load and solar power output for every ten minute period for a day and the effective usage of DG was compared and analysed. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Most of Egypt's population is concentrated in the Nile Valley (5% of Egypt's area), while the western desert occupies an area of 50% of the total area of Egypt with a small number of inhabitants. The New Valley is the largest governorates in Egypt which occupies 45.8% of the total area of the Country and 65% of the Western Desert and it is the least densely populated governorate in Egypt. However, New Valley has started to receive the migrated people from the Nile valley and Delta region and the demand for the energy is continuously increasing. However, the rural area in New Valley still suffers from lack of access to energy services. The very high transmission losses and costs are the main challenges for electrification in this area. Then, it is worth to investigate the opportunities for distributed energy generation. This area of Egypt receives some of the highest solar radiation in the world (up to 3000 kW h per square meters per year), making it a prime location for use of this resource. In this study, performance and economic assessment of a small scale stand-alone solar thermal co-generation plant using diathermic oil is presented. This configuration is considered as a promising and sustainable solution to provide electricity and heat to an isolated area satisfying the local loads. Parabolic trough plant has been modeled in TRNSYS simulation environment integrated with the Solar Thermal Electric Components (STEC) model library. Both solar and power cycle performances have been modeled based on the solar energy data of the plant site. The mirrors area and the solar collectors have been designed to optimize the incident solar energy. As a result, the parabolic trough solar power plant can produce 6 MW of electric power and 21.5 MW of heat power with an overall efficiency of about 85%. The analysis demonstrated that the solar operation time of the CSP plant in the selected site can be expanded to run during the all day without recurring to fossil fuel backup. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of the proposed power plant is estimated to be equal to 1.25 USD/kW h. The avoided GHG emissions are equal to about 7300 toe/year. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The plant consists of a wind turbine (1 kW permanent magnet) and 4 polycrystalline PV modules (87 Wp each), 5 batteries (150 Ah each) and 1 power electronic converter (1 kW). A datalloger is used for acquisition and storage of data (wind speed, global irradiance, water flow and electrical data). The present study uses data from four non-consecutive days in November/2014 and December/2014; in the first day only PV and the battery bank supply the load. The recorded mean flow was 25.26 L/min, showing little variation, even with intermittence of the resources, condition minimized by the energy storage. As a consequence of the energy storage, the hybrid system shows low operation request, enhancing the life cycle and consequently reducing the plant replacement costs. © 2015, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

The use of a simple device to increase solar radiation intensity (solar concentrator) was tested, with results showing that it facilitated better performance. A comparison between transparent and black-painted glass reactors was also made, showing no difference between the two casings. Further, the effect of an increase in water temperature was analysed in detail. Temperature was found to play an important role in the disinfection process, even in cases of limited solar radiation intensities, although a synergistic effect of water heating and solar radiation for effective microbial inactivation was confirmed. Reactor design is also discussed, highlighting the importance of having a plug flow to avoid zones that do not contribute to the overall effectiveness of the process. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.},

The advances in desalination technologies clearly show that desalinated water can be used as a substitute for freshwater to be used as potable water. A breakthrough in reverse osmosis costs has been reached, particularly in decreasing energy consumption. The introduction of nanotechnology in the membrane manufacture has resulted in reducing the volume of rejected brine which in turn alleviates the brine disposal issue. Several recent studies show that desalinated water for development of isolated areas is economically competitive to transportation of freshwater by pipeline. The introduction of solar energy to power desalination process has given a new dimension to the expansion of desalination technology. Several studies show the importance of solar desalination in countries suffering from freshwater shortage, particularly in isolated areas. This chapter presents an overview of desalination technologies with emphasis on solar energy-driven units. Some case studies are highlighted.

	abstract = {The electrification ratio in Indonesia has not yet achieved 100%, meaning there are still many areas without electricity access. As a key driven country development, electricity has a significant impact to the growth of telecommunication industries. In such situations, it is therefore difficult to guarantee the reliability of the telecommunication network, in particular, the electricity supply for the base transceiver station (BTS). To overcome this shortage, locally available renewable energy sources can be a solution as a power supply for a BTS. This study proposes the use of the integrated photovoltaic (PV) system as a power sources for BTS in the remote and isolated areas where the electricity from the grid is unavailable. The results show that the use of PV system is capable of supplying the electrical load requirement of BTS and is very feasible in financial analysis. The designed PV system output can produce 1.16 kW, while BTS load is 1.15 kW. We found that the integrated PV system is capable of handling BTS load. In economic perspective, the investment cost to deploy PV system is affordable due to the advantage of PV system, which is easy to maintain and operate. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {There has been a growing interest in microgrids because of various advantages such as environmental benefits through its integration with renewables, possible cost-efficient replacement of the electricity infrastructure in isolated areas, and improvement of reliability and resilience using multiple energy sources. However, the microgrid faces various challenges in operational management because it deals with a multitude of energy sources mainly comprising renewables (municipal solid waste incineration and solar and wind energy), fuels (natural gas, hydrogen, and biofuel), and batteries. In this work, we developed a mixed-integer linear programming model for cost-efficient and environmentally friendly scheduling in the microgrid operation. The model provides optimal schedules with minimal cost or reduced environmental impacts, e.g., global warming potential, while satisfying the balance of electricity supply and demand. Notably, an additional set of diversity constraints is incorporated within the model to ensure reasonable allocation of electricity generation from each source, thereby allowing us to maintain grid reliability. To demonstrate the applicability and utility of the model, a case study of a hypothetical microgid system in Singapore Island is presented. A comparison result with the national grid system clearly proves the cost efficiency and environmental friendliness of the microgrid. We also investigated the effects of uncertainty in local demands and seasonal weather conditions on the microgrid scheduling, suggesting capacity planning to manage the dependency on national grid and renewable sources. © 2012 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Aims. We present a study of the spectrophotometric properties of dwarf planet Ceres in the visual-to-infrared (VIS-IR) spectral range by means of hyper-spectral images acquired by the VIR imaging spectrometer on board the NASA Dawn mission. Methods. Disk-resolved observations with a phase angle within the 7° <α < 132° interval were used to characterize Ceres' phase curve in the 0.465-4.05 μm spectral range. Hapke's model was applied to perform the photometric correction of the dataset to standard observation geometry at VIS-IR wavelength, allowing us to produce albedo and color maps of the surface. The V-band magnitude phase function of Ceres has been computed from disk-resolved images and fitted with both the classical linear model and H-G formalism. Results. The single-scattering albedo and the asymmetry parameter at 0.55 μm are w = 0.14 ± 0.02 and ξ = -0.11 ± 0.08, respectively (two-lobe Henyey-Greenstein phase function); at the same wavelength, Ceres' geometric albedo as derived from our modeling is 0.094 ± 0.007; the roughness parameter is θ=29 ± pm. Albedo maps indicate small variability on a global scale with an average reflectance at standard geometry of 0.034 ± 0.003. Nonetheless, isolated areas such as the Occator bright spots, Haulani, and Oxo show an albedo much higher than average. We measure a significant spectral phase reddening, and the average spectral slope of Ceres' surface after photometric correction is 1.1% kA-1 and 0.85% kA-1 at VIS and IR wavelengths, respectively. Broadband color indices are V-R = 0.38 ± 0.01 and R-I = 0.33 ± 0.02. Color maps show that the brightest features typically exhibit smaller slopes. The H-G modeling of the V-band magnitude phase curve for α < 30° gives H = 3.14 ± 0.04 and G = 0.10 ± 0.04, while the classical linear model provides V(1,1,0°) = 3.48 ± 0.03 and β = 0.036 ± 0.002. The comparison of our results with spectrophotometric properties of other minor bodies indicates that Ceres has a less back-scattering phase function and a slightly higher albedo than comets and C-type objects. However, the latter represents the closest match in the usual asteroid taxonomy. © ESO, 2017.},

	abstract = {A hybrid power system uses many wind turbine generators (WTG) and solar photovoltaics (PV) in isolated small areas. However, the output power of these renewable sources is not constant and can diverge quickly, which has a serious effect on system frequency and the continuity of demand supply. In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a new frequency control scheme for a hybrid power system to ensure supplying a high-quality power in isolated areas. The proposed power system consists of a WTG, PV, aqua-electrolyzer (AE), fuel cell (FC), battery energy storage system (BESS), flywheel (FW) and diesel engine generator (DEG). Furthermore, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (EVs) are implemented at the customer side. A full-order observer is utilized to estimate the supply error. Then, the estimated supply error is considered in a frequency domain. The high-frequency component is reduced by BESS and FW; while the low-frequency component of supply error is mitigated using FC, EV and DEG. Two PI controllers are implemented in the proposed system to control the system frequency and reduce the supply error. The epsilon multi-objective genetic algorithm ("-MOGA) is applied to optimize the controllers' parameters. The performance of the proposed control scheme is compared with that of recent well-established techniques, such as a PID controller tuned by the quasi-oppositional harmony search algorithm (QOHSA). The effectiveness and robustness of the hybrid power system are investigated under various operating conditions.},

In this study the supercapacitor as energy storage, as opposed to batteries, has widely researched in recent years. Supercapacitors act like other capacitors, but their advantage is having enormous power storage capabilities. Maximum charging voltage and capacitance are two variables of storage in the supercapacitor. The supercapacitor is used as energy storage to charge a low power device wirelessly and act as a power supply. The solar energy is used as a backup power supply if there is no electricity in the remote or isolated area to charge the supercapacitor. The time taken to charge the supercapacitor depend on the amount of current rating of the solar panel. The higher the current, the shorter the time taken to charges the supercapacitor. Power supply using supercapacitor can store up to 30 Vdc using a DC-DC boost converter. © 2019 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The introduction of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in isolated areas which are far from the main grid has provided energy to non-electrified households. Such off-grid technology is very promising in the Asia Pacific region where increase in population and regional development has brought an increase in energy demand. This paper presents a methodology to assess the available supply of energy from solar PV systems and the corresponding demand from non-electrified areas. Non-electrified high population density areas were extracted using global population distribution and nightlight data, while the suitability of installing solar PV systems in those areas were identified based on slope, land cover and estimated solar PV power output. Moreover, the cost and benefits of installation were estimated based on the levelized cost of electricity generation from PV (LCOEPV) and the percentage in the total household budget that can shoulder the said expense. Lastly, this study also proposed a novel and simple method to extract the power transmission lines (TLs) based on global road network and nightlight data used for defining off-grid areas. Results show that there are three general types of electrification trend in the region with only 11 out 28 countries exhibiting the ideal trend of decreasing population living in unlit areas with increasing GDP. This study also generated maps showing the spatial distribution of high potential areas for solar PV installation in Cambodia, North Korea and Myanmar as case studies. To date, the high estimated household income allotted for PV electricity is still experienced in most countries in the region, but these countries also have high initial generated electricity from PV systems. Outputs from this study can provide stakeholders with relevant information on the suitable areas for installations in the region and the expected socio-economic benefits. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In rural areas, provision of drinking water is one of the most important requirements of living conditions, and most of these isolated areas are not connected to the electricity grid. Conventional technology solutions provided by diesel generators are costly because of high maintenance and fuel supply costs and have drawbacks related to noise and especially greenhouse gas emissions. New technological solutions provided by solar and wind water pumping systems are experiencing high growth rates in recent years. Because of their high initial capital cost, many studies on their optimal sizing have been carried out. In this paper, an optimal sizing model based on Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP) and Particle Swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed. The main goal is to deal with the optimal sizing problem of hybrid PV-Wind-based water pumping system taking into account the techno-economic aspects. The developed method uses the PSO algorithm to find the optimal configuration of the studied hybrid system insuring minimum cost and satisfying a desired loss of power supply probability. A computing code is developed and a flexible graphical interface is designed. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This study aims to analyze the benefits of applying a Zero Energy Building (ZEB) as an alternative to conventional buildings in isolated and environmental protected areas in Brazil as a hosting unit. A Zero Energy Solar-House (ZESH) is defined, considering its fabrication, assembly systems, use of natural resources and strategies for energy efficiency, leading to low environmental impact. A Brazilian scenery is described regarding energy feeding conditions in isolated areas, the occupation of protection areas, which are coveted by real estate market and touristic exploitation, and the consequent environmental impact. The ZESH harnesses sun's energy throughout a photovoltaic (PV) system for energy generation, solar collectors for water heating and passive environmental conditioning. Besides, it has local wastewater treatment and solid waste management systems, reducing the environmental impact arising from the occupants activities. To verify the ZESH model, this study takes the Ekó House Project, an efficient solar house prototype that meets the ZESH premises. This study results in accounting greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions reduction by the solar PV electricity generation instead of diesel generators. Results point out a potential to avoid up to 14.4 t of CO2/year for one ZESH unit. It is observed that the ZESH contributes to enable the occupation of these areas by local communities or touristic exploitation with responsibility, low resources consumption and reducing the environmental impact when compared to conventional buildings, allowing these areas to develop on a sustainable way and benefiting local communities. © Copyright: CEPT University, Center for Advanced Research in Building Science & Energy, Ahmedabad First Published 2014.All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The energy systems of isolated areas are different from the stable energy systems of mainland areas. The particularity of isolated areas creates more risks for their energy systems planning, and the isolated areas can be considered to be a more specific analysis target than mainland areas. Various energy models and systems have been developed and applied in isolated areas. The major objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive literature review to identify, classify, evaluate and analyze the performance of different methodologies, models and energy systems for isolated areas. Therefore, effective information could be provided to support decision-making toward to appropriate energy models and systems for isolated areas with different scales and demands. This paper reviewed the forecasting techniques of energy demand and renewable energy (RE) resources, energy models, application of hybrid RE systems (HRESs), and management of energy planning for two most representative isolated areas: islands and remote villages. The uncertainty analysis of energy systems of isolated areas is also discussed. It is evident that the indigenous RE resources show great potentials for the energy system of isolated areas, especially the solar and wind resources. The various combinations of photovoltaic (PV), wind, diesel and batteries have been proven more competitive. Also, it is necessary to develop sophisticated models that are more applicable to isolated areas and that consider the distinctive characteristics, practical needs and uncertainties of isolated areas. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {A photovoltaic switched reluctance motor converts light energy into mechanical energy, without power electronics, brushes or magnets. With the rapid decrease of photovoltaic cells price, its simplicity makes it ideal for low cost, autonomous and reliable applications, such as water pumping in isolated areas with good solar irradiation. But the concept does not allow for motion control or variable-speed operation. In order to evaluate its range of application, then to optimize its sizing, we need to understand the complex interactions between the photovoltaic cells and the motor. To this end, we develop here a numerical model of our photovoltaic switched reluctance motor prototype. It takes into account the nonlinearity of photovoltaic cells and of the switched reluctance machine. Despite the uncommon operation of the photovoltaic cells, the agreement between the simulation and the measures is so far good, thus validating our modeling strategy. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Electrification ratio in Indonesia by the end of 2011 was about 74%. This means that 26% of the population does not have electricity. Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) is developing small scale concentrated solar power plant using Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) that can be operated in remote, isolated areas or small islands. Some constraints of electrification in these areas are the cost of integrated grid construction is relatively high, the limitation of energy resources and the population of the area is relatively small. Reseach in concentrated solar power (parabolic trough) has been carried out by LIPI since 2010. A stand-alone power unit ("off grid") by utilizing local energy resources, especially renewable energy, will be constructed by LIPI. A hybrid system of solar thermal and biomass energy can be a suitable choice to solve the electricity problem in the area. This option is based on the relatively good potential intensity of solar energy in some areas of Indonesia which is daily average intensity is about 4.8 kWh/m2/day. This paper presents a series of activities in developing a concentrated solar power plant which includes the conceptual design of the small-scale system with the capacity of 10kW. © 2013 The Authors.

	abstract = {Salted water occupies the greatest part in the world, but we are not using all of it because of its saline character. In addition, there is an excessive consumption of energy in most systems of desalination which leads to generating gases that cause global warming. Besides, in certain countries of the world this energy is not available in great quantity. Distillation is an operation which transforms, by heating, the seawater or brackish water into vapor. Through condensation, this vapor gives water of great purity. Among the various processes, solar distillation is an interesting solution in the isolated areas. The objective of our work is to study the transfers of heat and mass in a solar distillatory. Thus, we studied the evaluation of the thermophysical properties and the effect of the properties of humid air-as binary mixture of water vapor and dry air-on the coefficient of transfer of heat by convection and the evaporative ratio of thermal coefficient of transfer and the flow of the distillate. In addition to these theoretical results, we have replicated previous experimental investigations. We have also established equations governing the operation of a solar distiller with capillary film, in the resolution based on the numerical approach based on the method of Runge-Kutta. The results obtained show that the effect of relative humidity and the differences in temperature between the pan and brine on the convective coefficient and thermophysical parameters of solar distiller. © 2013 Desalination Publications.},

This paper presents a lexicographic multi-objective optimisation model (LMOM) to select the best renewable energy technologies (solar and wind) of hybrid power generation systems (HPGSs) for communities located in non-interconnected zones.

In addition, the model considers constraints related to the production cost, environmental sustainability, environmental conditions and reliability of the system. The results show that the model provides sustainable HPGSs adapted to the size of each community and the best renewable energy technologies are the central receiver system and the wind turbine with a 20-m tower.                          © 2019, Econjournals.

	abstract = {The use of solar energy had gained a great attention last decades, as it is pollution-free. It is used in isolated areas for lighting, pumping, etc. However, the extraction of the maximum power generated by a PVG at any moment of the day is a big deal because the characteristic of a PVG in nonlinear which makes the location of the Maximum Power Point (MPP) difficult. Therefore, a Maximum Power Point Tracking technique (MPPT) is required to maximize the output power. In this paper, a photovoltaic water pumping system has been studied. This system consists of three main parts: PVG, a DC-DC boost converter and a DC motor coupled with a centrifugal water pump. We have proposed a new MPPT algorithm based on Fuzzy logic and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to improve the system performances. The ANN is used to predict the optimal voltage of the PVG, under different environmental conditions (temperature and solar irradiance) and the fuzzy controller is used to command the DC-DC boost converter. The proposed method is compared to P&O technic, by simulation under Matlab/Simulink, to verify its effectiveness. © 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.},

Studies of DLR MED-CSP project show that Iran can be a part of the Mediterranean solar power generation chain in 2050 to provide electrical power demand of Europe. High direct solar radiation and available desert lands in Iran are factors to encourage the full development of solar power plants like solar chimney power plants for the thermal and electrical productions of energy for various uses. The interested region is the central region of Iran where solar radiation and global insolation are much better than other areas. However, to evaluate SCPP performance and power generation throughout Iran, 12 different areas across the country are considered. The obtained results clear that solar chimney power plants can produce from 10 to 28 MWh/month of electrical power. This power production is sufficient for the needs of the isolated areas and can even used to feed the grid. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The rock glaciers are 250-1,200 ft long and 200-400 ft wide. They have abrupt fronts, lateral ridges that delineate the flanks, and depressed areas extending from the crests of the fronts to the heads. They are composed of blocks and slabby clasts of igneous rock with lengths of 2-3 ft. Isolated areas on the rock-glacier surfaces are covered by an azonal soil of decomposed organic material approximately 6 inches thick. The rock glaciers moved by flow of interstitial ice; their formation 3,050 ft below the Wisconsin orographic snow line in southern New Mexico is attributed to the overlying debris, which protected the ice from wind and solar radiation.},

	abstract = {The present work outlines the designing, erection and operation process of a stand-alone desalination plant powered by both solar photovoltaic and wind energy. Such a plant will serve small isolated communities in remote areas devoid of water resources. A specially customized code was built to simulate the operation of the installation in order to allow appropriate choice of components specifications. Site meteorological data were used to enhance prediction capabilities. The code continuously updates the instantaneous water lever of the reservoir as well as the current state of charge of the accumulators. Depending on these two variables, a logical decision tree is built to decide whether the cumulated wind and solar energy production can satisfy the load of the plant or additional energy must be provided from the accumulators or an auxiliary diesel engine generator. The process control system for such an installation must allow for operation in isolated areas where qualified maintenance personnel are scarce or remote. These are special considerations regarding the design philosophy in order to reach a state as close as possible to a maintenance-free system. In view of this consideration, several layers of back-up were built into the system such as a diesel generator (whose use is to be kept to a minimum). Also, the system has been designed to operate at about a 33% service factor. Two-day battery storage autonomy has also been provided. The desalination plant uses reverse osmosis technology. The plant has a maximum product capacity of 9 m3/d in view of future needs, even though it is designed to currently produce only 3 m 3/d. The inlet water is to be provided from on-site brackish water wells. The local water quality is approximately 3500-5000 ppm corresponding to brackish water. The system has been designed based on the premise that the average on-site wind velocity is about 4-5 m/s and an insolation level of about 5-5.5 k Wh/m2/d. The expected life-span of the plant is about 15 years. The system was successfully erected and has been continuously operated producing 3 m3/d. Experimental measurements are now in progress, and a comparison to theoretical predictions is presented. The time schedule for the whole project consisted of 6-8 months, including many changes required during construction.},

Experimental data are sufficient for establishing a statistical correlation between heat extraction and meteorological parameters: insolation, diurnal and nocturnal temperatures. The influences of these parameters are also evaluated through operation analysis. Both approaches are rather consistent. Nocturnal temperature appears to be a quite important factor. Indeed, cold nights (around 10°C) largely increase production. Meteorological conditions for producing either just no ice at all or 5.2 kg, are investigated, as well as an evaluation of yearly production: in Agadir, the average daily production lies around 4 kg/m2. With a nocturnal cooling system, the units would produce around 1 kg more. From the economic point of view, small units such as those tested herein are too expensive, but solarization of a pre-existing cold store in isolated areas looks competitive. © 1992.},

The study concluded that the lowest water cost is 1.8$/m3 for RO unit powered by either a diesel generator or by a combination of diesel, wind, and solar power. Relying on renewable energy only increase the water cost to 2.3-2.4$/m3 depending on the source type.

WVN effectiveness can be augmented when coupled with a network of low-power, low-cost Pyroelectric InfraRed (PIR) detectors to form a multimodal surveillance system. Autonomy is a key issue as battery replacement is often impractical and even using energy scavenging techniques, such as solar harvester, ad-hoc power management policies are essential to extend network lifetime. In this paper we propose a cooperative policy to manage power consumption of a WVN powered by solar scavengers and supported by a network of PIR sensors that perform a coarse classification of movements. A cost function is calculated by each VSN according to its available energy and information from the PIR network. Such functions are used by a distributed energy aware policy that selects the best VSN to observe the activity. This VSN locally analyzes the image and detects whether or not it represents a person, and only this information is forwarded to users. The effectiveness of this technique is evaluated through simulation and compared to an approach presented in previous work. Results show an increase in system lifetime without any loss in people detection ratio. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Programs, such as feed-in-tariffs (FITs) implemented in many countries for on-grid PV, provide economic incentives for investment. On the other hand, off-grid PV systems reduce energy poverty and increase both entrepreneurial productivity and return in rural isolated areas. Despite these social and economic justifications, there is still limited access to capital and appropriate financing mechanisms for the upfront cost, resulting in the slow uptake of solar PV under government programs, especially for poorer individuals. Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending networks represent an abundant untapped financial resource for accelerating the deployment of PV technology. This paper considers an innovative P2P lending framework for A) financing solar PV on-grid under a FIT program and B) off-grid for a small business, whilst distributing both the environmental and economic advantages throughout the entire population. The requirements and limitations of the proposed funding mechanisms are analyzed and conclusions are drawn. Copyright © (2011) by the American Solar Energy Society.},

	abstract = {The use of renewable energy is currently very limited in Russia. It accounts for only 3.5 % of the country's primary energy consumption and barely 1 % excluding large hydro. While the Soviet regime encouraged research as early as the 1920s, centralized energy planning policies and the overuse of fossil fuels (Russia is the world's leading oil and gas producer and exporter), put a quick end to this. Renewable energy could, however, meet real needs, by compensating unequal regional access to energy (some devote more than half of their budget to energy), improving supply to isolated areas or, in terms of a sustainable energy policy, to limit fossil fuel consumption. Russia does, in effect, have an extremely vast renewable energy potential (hydro, wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, tidal), which could count for nearly 30 % of its primary energy consumption, particularly important for some regions poorly-endowed with energy resources (Kamtchatka, for example) where renewable energy use could easily become competitive. However, investments will really only develop if the government initiates a support policy by precisely calculating objectives for renewable energy use and financial aid in the form of subsidies or repurchasing prices.},

	abstract = {There is no widely accepted explanation for the origin of intraplate earthquakes. The central Virginia seismic zone, like other seismically active intraplate areas, is a spatially isolated area of persistent, diffuse earthquake activity. We suggested earlier that rainfall plays a key role in the generation of intraplate seismicity ("hydroseismicity"). Observed long-period (10-30 years) changes in streamflow (rainfall) are hypothesized to generate intraplate seismicity by diffusion of pore pressure transients from recharge areas of groundwater basins to depth as deep as the brittle-ductile transition. Streamflow and earthquake strain for a 62-year sample from 1925 to 1987 in the central Virginia seismic zone were cumulated, and a least-squares straight-line fit was subtracted to obtain residuals of streamflow and strain. Residual streamflow was differentiated to obtain the rate of change of residual streamflow. We observed common cyclicities with periods of 10-30 years for residual streamflow and strain. From the one-dimensional diffusion equation, we determined the time response of fluid pressure at depths, ψ, in a hydraulically diffusive crust to an impulsive change in fluid pressure at the surface of a groundwater basin. These responses were convolved with the surface streamflow residuals, or, because of results from reservoir-induced seismicity, with the derivatives of these residuals. Root-mean-square values (rms) of the convolutions were computed for ψ = 5, 10, 15 and 20 km and various values of D. For central Virginia, the number of earthquakes, N, within a crustal slice centered on a depth, ψ, was found to be proportional to the rms value of the convolution, suggesting that the number of intraplate earthquakes generated is directly proportional to the magnitude of the rms changes in fluid pore pressure within the crustal slice. These fluctuations in pore pressure, in concert with stress corrosion and hydrolytic weakening, are hypothesized to trigger intraplate earthquakes in a crust stressed by ridge-push. Crosscorrelation of the residual streamflow convolutions with residual strain, provides a measure of similarity between the streamflow convolution and the strain. Optimum values of crustal diffusivity, D, were considered to be those values for which the Crosscorrelation function looks approximately even. That this occurs only over a reasonable range of diffusivities (near D = 50 km2/year) is consistent with the hypothesized causal relationship between streamflow and intraplate seismicity. Finally, others have shown a clear relationship between the 11-year solar cycle and storm track latitudes in the North Atlantic. Storm tracks over the eastern United States and Canada indicate that north of 50 ° N, the average latitude of storm tracks during December, January, and February is about 2.5 ° farther south at sunspot maximum than at sunspot minimum. A correlation with the 11-year solar cycle was discovered by Labitzke (1987). Significantly, we recognize a clear peak near 11 years in the Fourier spectra of actual (not residual) streamflow in the James River in the central Virginia seismic zone. © 1991.},

	abstract = {The increasing demand for simple, but high-technology devices, bringing solutions to problems faced by people in diverse situations, has led many to an ongoing effort to improve techniques and processes, trying to achieve the expected requirements of those particular devices. In the same way, an important attempt to develop self-sustainable and low environmental impact equipments, with improved performance, can be easily seen nowadays. At this point, an important matter is the supply of electric energy in places where it is unavailable, due to the distance from the power grid, or even in places where the ecosystem is of great importance, preventing the construction of any type of distribution network. One solution, frequently employed in these cases, is the use of internal combustion engine generators or even archaic lampions for illumination, resulting in a high environmental impact, due the burning of fossil fuels and consequently carbon emission. Through Bibliographic and Experimental research, as well as seminars and interactions with specialists of the area, it was possible to develop the idea of a device that fits within the proposed requirements. This paper aims to introduce the idea of a Solar Powered Battery Charger with Self-Oriented Panel, completely independent of a power grid, with efficiency as close as possible to the commercial chargers which, otherwise, depend on an electrical socket to work.},

The absence of a 24-hour basis availability brings forth electricity conversion and storage issues. These factors have led the hybrid power systems to gather increasing interest of R&D studies. Hybrid power systems, those who consists of two or more different type generators, are seen as a way to provide power to remote residences or small communities in the developing world where the costs for large scale expansion of electrical grids is prohibitive and the transportation cost of fossil fuels is also high. The aim of this paper is to examine the feasibility of various hybrid power generation systems covering the electrical needs of a typical family house which is grid independent. The residential load is comprised by certain consumption profiles in heating, cooling, lighting, refrigeration and other appliances. The absence of grid connection in isolated areas together with the economic disadvantages of the enlargement of the grid to these areas, may set off the widest application and utilization of small autonomous hybrid systems. ©2009 IEEE.},

Fresh samples of skin were measured under a solar simulator, taking account of the pigmentation of hair and skin and the structural characteristics of the haircoat (coat thickness, hair diameter, hair length, angle of the hairs to the skin surface, number of hairs per unit area), which defined the average free path length of a photon within the coat, L. White hairs with high L values showed the highest transmission coefficients, while black hairs presented in general very low or even nul transmission. The best protection against UV was given by black hairs with low L values over a black skin. However, because of the heating by absorption of thermal radiation (in a Holstein cow the temperature of the black spots reach 44.1°C at the same time that of the white spots is 37.7°C), the best choice for tropical environments will be a white coat with a low L value over a black skin. This is a combination hardly found in European cattle, however in the present study a Holstein cow was found with isolated areas of white hair over black skin. An alternative choice would be a black coat with a low L value. Red animals presented high UV transmission coefficients through both the coat and the skin, and are not good choices for tropical environments, unless they have also a high pigmented skin.},

Our objective is to guarantee the reliability of the photovoltaic power generation equipments located in remote and isolated areas, including photovoltaic pumping stations, expected to supply water to local people for human consumption and for livestock from drilling isolated. Thus, we are focused particularly on the reliability of these systems and their maintenance in operational mode. The introduction of the e-maintenance can reduce cost and time management of equipment, and provide easy access to relevant information for the user by freeing up geographical constraints. Our study aims to introduce the techniques proposed by the e-Maintenance, to improve the management of the maintenance process. In this project a cooperative distributed platform of e-maintenance is proposed, including data acquisition systems, control, maintenance management, diagnosis assistance, management of documentation, etc. An e-maintenance platform is a collaboration platform offering a set of software components and software services for maintenance support (integrated and/or distant) all enable maintenance actors to find each other, and the information they need, and to be able to communicate and work together to achieve maintenance process. In this platform, the process of the various modules must be designed following a process of knowledge capitalization and data processing to ensure the diagnosis and prognosis of the pumping system of the Photovoltaic system and thus ensure its reliability.

The second part presents the utilization of produced hydrogen to generate electric power. The design of a closed loop cycle for electrolyzer and fuel cell to produce hydrogen and generate electrical energy, respectively, depending on a renewable energy source, is considered. Five different types of electrolyzer and fuel cells are studied to depict the effect of these types with respect to the current, voltage, cell temperature, cell pressure, sizing, and the required number of modules to produce one cubic meter of hydrogen per one hour. According to the various types of electrolyzer and fuel cell, multi PV systems are designed to produce 10 m3/day of hydrogen. The daily PV solar energy consumption to produce 10 m3 of hydrogen gas is calculated. Also, I-V and P-V characteristics of PV arrays for different percentages of insolation for the selected isolated area (Aswan) are calculated. The results show that the first type of electrolyzer (conventional alkaline) is the most economical one to produce hydrogen gas at the lowest values of the electrical current and voltage. The first and the second types of the fuel cells (alkaline & polymer membrane) generate a higher value of electrical energy than the others. Copyright © 1999 Taylor & Francis.},

The WTG, at its present status related to cost and also at its possible future status, is compared with the conventional thermal unit. Similar investigation is made in the paper for the PVG. Unlike many attempts in the past, the temperature dependent probabilistic models of WTGs and PVGs are developed for the evaluation of reliability and cost.

The objective is to design a 2 kW refrigeration equipment for isolated areas with a high level of solar radiation to meet refrigeration requirements. The equipment has been designed to operate with a concentrating solar power system to obtain the required temperatures. The heat exchangers, which act as condensers, as well as the absorber and evaporator, are all made of galvanized steel piping having fins. The design uses natural convection; the generator and energy-saving heat exchanger have a multi-tubular arrangement and a transfer tank is used in place of a pump for displacing the ammonia solution. All of the operations are manually controlled. Overall, the test results showed unsatisfactory operation of the equipment having low efficiency. Nevertheless, the proposed objectives have been met and it is evident that with several important modifications the equipment will operate satisfactorily. In conclusion, based on the development phase, it is apparent that future prototypes must be more compact and more efficient. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This paper first reviews both the wind power and photovoltaic (PV) power generation techniques and their maximum-power-point tracking (MPPT) methods. Then, a new stand-alone windPV hybrid generation system is proposed for application to remote and isolated areas. For the wind power generation branch, a new doubly excited permanent-magnet brushless machine is used to capture the maximum wind power by using online flux control. For the PV power generation branch, a single-ended primary inductance converter is adopted to harness the maximum solar power by tuning the duty cycle. The experimental results confirm that the proposed hybrid generation system can provide high efficiency with the use of MPPT. © 2006 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The autonomous PV systems cover a wide area of the applications that can be developed in the country, in places far from the national grid and with a low demand of electric power. The electrification of homes and farms in rural areas by using PV systems would contribute to improving the inhabitants' social, economic and cultural standard. In Romania, it is estimated that there are about 10,000 homes, farms and schools located in more than 500 settlements which could be electrified by using PV systems. The individual solar home systems would allow each user to adjust his own electricity consumption according to weather variations. A major problem in the development of these systems is the identification of the optimum technical and economic solutions as well as of the main financing sources. The paper aims to present the technical, economic and social problems involved by the implementation of such a project of PV-based electrification in Romania, presenting the particular case of two settlements (Scarisoara and Prisacina) located in the Cerna Valley - the Banat Mountains. © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {An experimental facility to evaluate the long-duration influence of microwave to environment, a so-called long duration microwave exposure facility (LDMEF), was constructed in Tsukuba in 1994, and so far irradiation tests on plants accumulated over 40,000 hours have been conducted with the aid of 2.45 GHz magnetron. The LDMEF consists of a pair of outdoor electromagnetically isolated areas, one under the influence of microwave irradiation with a 500 W magnetron and one without microwave irradiation. The growth rates of plants in both areas were compared and evaluated with the experimental data for the temperature distribution in the soil and power distribution of microwave. Although any appreciable influence of microwave was not noticed in the power density less than 10 mW/cm2, the experimental results showed a significant growth rate enhancement when the power density became over 10 mW/cm2. However, the growth was rather depressed when the power density increased over 15 mW/cm2. These effects are well explained by the temperature and moisture in the soil which are also under an appreciable influence of microwave irradiation [1,2]. In this context, we newly constructed an indoor irradiation facility, in which the growth conditions of plants under a constant soil temperature can be maintained. In addition, irradiation with a 5.8 GHz magnetron will be conducted in the new facility. In parallel to a series of indoor and outdoor irradiation tests on plants, the influence of microwave irradiation on the growth pattern of albino mouse will be conducted. This experiment will be the first experimental evaluation for the influence of microwave irradiation on animals.},

The problem of tracking the maximum power point for charging solar batteries is considered. In the literature, there are several techniques for the research of the point corresponding to the maximum power delivered by the panels. The optimal operating point of the PV systems is estimated by linear approximations. These approximations reduce considerably the performances of the PV systems. In this work, we are interested in the modelling of the photovoltaic system. To prove a validation of the system model, we proceed to a simulating in Matlab/Simulink software environment of this system. Both simulation and experimental results are presented. From those results, the models obtained coincide with reality and can be employed for the development of the control algorithms.},

These characteristics would allow the development of a class of robots that may be used in unfriendly and isolated areas, in which solar energy is adequate. Yet another goal is to develop a database documenting how the demonstrator operates under various conditions. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {Lack of access to electricity grid form the main challenge facing majority of developing regions particularly in rural communities. The situation is driven mostly by the absence of electricity infrastructure in most of the developing countries particularly in rural communities. A number of developing countries are now encouraging the use of solar home systems in isolated areas. Botswana is not immune to this trend. Consequently, available evidence puts the overall contribution of solar energy to primary energy supply in Botswana to less than 1%. A plethora of factors are responsible for inhibiting rapid development of solar home systems in isolated areas in Botswana. Some major impediments often cited as causing low use of solar home systems by rural communities in Botswana include, among others, the following:(i)Low-income status of most rural inhabitants.(ii)Migration of house-owners from village status to lands, or cattle posts. This paper, therefore, analyses factors that impede the rapid development of photovoltaics power generation systems in rural environments in Botswana. The analysis is based on photovoltaic power generation pilot project which was carried out in three (3) villages in Botswana, namely Kudumatse, Lorolwana and Motlhabaneng. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The MRoI is a simple realization of the magnetic environment in the photosphere, reflecting the distance required to balance the integrated magnetic field contained in any magnetogram pixel. It provides a new perspective on where subterrestrial field lines in a Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) model connect to the photosphere, and thus the source of Earth-directed solar wind (within the limitations of PFSS models), something that is not usually obvious from a regular synoptic magnetogram. In each of three sample solar rotations, at different phases of the solar cycle, the PFSS footpoint either jumps between isolated areas of high MRoI or moves slowly within one such area. Footpoint motions are consistent with Fisk's interchange reconnection model. © 2009. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) systems have found fairly wide application in remote isolated area. However, each individual PV system usually supplies energy only to one consumer. In such a case we have several consumers that each one of them uses a stand-alone PV system. This situation would expose such stand-alone systems to transient excessive loads larger than the power generated by the PVs, and then the battery is bound to discharge even during the day. For overcoming this problem, we suggest an autonomous centralized PV system, comprising one battery bank and plural subsystems connected to each other. From solar radiation data and load profiles, the performance of the PV centralized system is simulated by using a time step scheme. The advantages of this system are found to be the large charging rate of power, high efficiency, and low cost compared with conventional individual PV systems and hybrid systems. In addition, the economic study shows that the life cycle cost and the price of kilowatt hour generated in the centralized system is lower than that for the individual systems. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are becoming useful as alternate approaches to conventional techniques or as components of integrated systems. They have been used to solve complicated practical problems in various areas and are becoming popular more and more nowadays. AI techniques have the following features: can learn from examples; are fault tolerant in the sense that they are able to handle noise and incomplete data; are able to deal with non-linear problems; and once trained can perform prediction and generalization at high speed. AI-based systems are being developed and deployed worldwide in a myriad of applications, mainly because of their symbolic reasoning, flexibility and explanation capabilities. AI have been used and applied in different sectors, such as engineering, economic, medicine, military, marine, etc. They have also been applied for modeling, identification, optimization, prediction, forecasting, and control of complex systems. The main objective of this paper is to present an overview of the alternative approach and AI techniques for modeling and forecasting of meteorological data. Published literature works presented in this paper show the potential of AI as a design tool for prediction and forecasting of meteorological data, these includes, solar radiation, mean temperature, wind speed, humidity, cleanness index, etc. Additionally the advantage of using an AI-based prediction meteorological data in isolated areas where there no instrument for the measurement of this data, especially the parameters related to PV-systems such as solar radiation data. A new intelligent hardware based on neural network and FPGA (Filed Programming Gate Array) implementation is proposed for estimating solar radiation from air temperature and sunshine duration. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

A database of total solar radiation data for 60 sites in Algeria has been used to determine the iso-reliability curves of a PVS system (CA, CS) for each site. Initially, the GA is used for determining the optimal coefficient (CAop, CSop) for each site by minimising the optimal cost (objective function). These coefficients allow the determination of the number of PV modules and the capacity of the battery. Subsequently, an ANFIS is used for the prediction of the optimal coefficient in remote areas based only on geographical coordinates. Therefore, 56 couples of CAop and CSop have been used for the training of the network and four couples have been used for testing and validation of the proposed technique. The simulation results have been analysed and compared with the alternative techniques. The technique has been applied and tested for Algeria locations, but it can be generalised for any location in the world.},

Solar electricity systems can represent a cost-effective alternative to high cost, conventional, diesel-fired generators, particularly in developing countries where most of the population lives in rural and isolated areas. However, the lack of simple but accurate analytic design tools currently results in either (a) significant, wasteful oversizing or (b) extremely high design costs for one-of-a-kind projects. The analytic solutions discussed here can bring the price of stand-alone photovoltaic systems to economic viabilty at today's hardware and fuel prices, and can also enable local designers in developing countries to design these systems economically and on their own. The analytic models are based on the theory of stochastic processes, and stem from analyses originally developed for analogous water reservoir, queueing and insurance risk problems. © 1987.},

Of this incident energy 30% is reflected to space, 45% absorbed, converted into heat and returned to space as IR radiation, 22% contribute to evaporation, 2% to the kinetic energy of winds, 0.06% to photosynthesis, and 0.02% to renewable geothermal energy. Solar energy can be used as thermal energy or as electricity. Although the cost of photovoltaic electricity is much higher, by a factor typically of the order of 10, than that obtained using fossil fuels or nuclear energy, the prices are decreasing. Despite this, it is an especially interesting energy for isolated areas for which it otherwise would be necessary to invest in kilometers of electrical power lines at FF ~ 200,000-400,000/km. In 1997, there was a 43% increase in production of photovoltaic modules. In Europe, Germany, and The Netherlands have stimulated photovoltaics so that there has been a 56% increase in photovoltaics in Europe. Photovoltaics are reliable, modular, low in operating cost, and non-polluting. Companies involved are discussed.},

	abstract = {To provide renewable energy to stand alone applications the generation system should be composed of different types of energy sources to make better use of the natural resources in these applications. A common practice is to combine wind and solar PV energies in the so called hybrid renewable systems. Due to the long distance, and difficult access the overall system used in these applications must be reliable. And the reliability of the system, specially the inverter used to regulate the AC voltage, is one of the main problems associated to these systems, and is responsible for the lack of confidence in renewable systems at several locations in Brazil. This paper shows the initial results of using renewable hybrid systems specially designed for isolated areas, focusing attention on reliability, efficiency and expansion flexibility. It presents the system description, mode of operation, inverter design, and experimental results measured in a pilot plant located in Lençôis Island, a small isolated community in the northeast region of Brazil. © 2009 IEEE.},

On the other hand, the energy requirements of desalination processes are high. Then, the energy supply in low development countries or isolated areas may be a problem, especially if electricity is required. Since most arid regions have high renewable energy resources, the use of renewable energies in seawater desalination exhibits an interesting chance, or even the only way to offer a secure source of fresh water. The status and perspectives of development of coupling renewable energy systems with desalination units are reviewed. It is pointed out that there are place of development even for such technologies that seem to be the most mature ones. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The interest in technologies related to microgeneration has increased over the last decade. Hydro, wind and solar power represent some of the technologies which had significant improvement. Among these technologies, micro hydro power stations with self-excited induction generators (IG) became an excellent choice for limited power generation in isolated areas, due basically to its robustness and low cost, compared to synchronous machine. This paper describes the controllers for micro hydro power stations for island operation based on nonlinear model of hydraulic turbine with a self-excited induction generators. Frequency control is obtained by a speed governor applied to the turbine feed system while constant voltage control is reached through reactive power control using a voltage source inverter (VSI). In order to reach effective frequency control, it is proposed the use of a motor flux estimation algorithm to obtain the measurement of instantaneous rotor speed without using a mechanical sensor applied on his shaft resulting in inherent cost reduction. Simulation results are given and they illustrate the transient behavior due step changes in load and frequency reference setting point. © 2011 IEEE.},
