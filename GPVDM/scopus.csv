Wind energy, combined with other renewable energy systems, has resulted in a more reliable, feasible, and efficient stand-alone system, known as a hybrid renewable energy system, in which excess energy is stored in batteries. To make hybrid renewable energy systems more efficient using economical energy storage, even in off-grid mode, various other energy combinations have been implemented. In analysing the various combinations of hybrid renewable energy systems, economic factors, such as fuel cost, cost of energy, net present cost, and capital cost, as well as technical factors, namely duty factor, excess energy, average energy production, and unmet load, are considered. The consideration of both economic and technical factors provides comprehensive guidance in determining the optimum load combination, storage type and capacity, off-grid and on-grid simulation details, energy balancing, scale of optimum production, risk assessments, and investor confidence. Accordingly, the operation of hybrid renewable energy systems has improved and become more reliable. Furthermore, the improvement of hybrid renewable energy system performance owing to techno-economic assessments has significantly reduced the costs of battery energy storage used in hybrid renewable energy systems as a backup system. In addition, such improvements in hybrid renewable energy system operation have enabled enhanced applications of these systems in the off-grid mode and resulted in the reduction of high grid upgrading and extension costs in various locations. Hybrid renewable energy systems facilitate the economical distribution of distributed electricity generation in various isolated areas with low density. The analytical methods described in the literature cover various aspects and factors considered in the techno-economic assessments of hybrid renewable energy systems in several countries. This study reviews the penetration of wind power into hybrid renewable energy systems as a solution to current energy deficiencies in different countries around the world. The review is conducted based on the available technical and economic factors of different countries to analyse the wind power penetration in various hybrid systems. Asian countries are noted to have the potential to penetrate wind energy into hybrid systems, yet some constraints, such as lack of experience and information, are a major limitation. Furthermore, in European countries, curtailment, high -wake effects, and financial difficulties are common. The technical development of wind power is insufficient in African countries. European countries are ahead in terms of the technical development of wind power penetration into hybrid systems. In some developed countries, such as Germany, hydrogen is used for energy storage, while batteries and generators are used in most Asian countries. In European, Asian, and North and South American countries, the solar/wind combination was identified as economical whereas photovoltaic and diesel/wind were in African countries. Despite these challenges, almost all countries have identified the potential for wind power generation using the available wind energy resources. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Cost of energy; Electrical energy;

One such area is the Pantanal, which is one of the world’s largest wetlands and located in the central-west region of Brazil. The energy supply to this region is complex not only due to technical aspects but also, and primarily, because of environmental issues such as large areas under environmental preservation and seasonal flooding. To incorporate environmental feasibility into decision-making for the electricity supply to remote areas, a survey of the environmental aspects of several supply alternatives was performed. Solar, wind and fossil-fuel power generation sources and the expansion of the conventional power grid were considered. Using multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), these alternatives were scaled, scored and weighted to develop socioenvironmental indices, which express the socioenvironmental impact of the supply alternatives in the affected areas. The results, presented in the form of georeferenced maps, are essential for identifying and measuring the existence and scope of impact of the supply alternatives and represent an important support source for decision-makers. © 2019, © 2019 IAIA.","alternative energy; Energy generation; MCDA; Pantanal; socioenvironmental indices; weighted sum","Pantanal; alternative energy; decision analysis; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy use; multicriteria analysis; solar power; wind power","","","","","Energisa Mato Grosso do Sul Distribuidora de Energia S.

The efforts to fulfill the demand had been carried out by the local government by distributing the Solar Home System (SHS) to all households in 2013. However, the SHS performance quickly declined because the solar panels in the rooftop covered by dense and lush trees, and then it did not work at all in 2018. This research performs pre-feasibility in building the micro-hydro powerplant (MHPP) and its sustainability potential in Tumba Hamlet to fulfill the community's electrical energy needs without disrupting the Nantu Boliyohuto Wildlife Reserve. A basic survey was performed in exploring river resources and topographical conditions in this hamlet. Sustainability study, including technical, social, and environmental aspects, was conducted by interviewing the residents. The results show that the power needs in Tumba Hamlet are 48.5 kW. This demand can be fulfilled by the MHPP with head and water discharge of 10 meters and 0.706 m3/s, respectively. It was found that positive feedback in the technical, social, and environmental aspects of sustainability is dominant. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

This scenario can be significantly reduced by the implementation of renewable technologies and transforming farms from energy consumers to energy providers. In the particular case of livestock production, biogas and solar energy reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the energy demand of the installations. However, the implementation of these technologies requires solutions adapted to local scenarios, such as connectivity to the energy grids. In this work, a biogas/biomethane production system, energetically covered with hybrid solar panels is proposed as a solution for isolated areas where biodegradable substrates (manure) are abundant. Thus, the electrical and thermal requirements of the digester are supplied by solar panels, reducing the biogas self-consumption and the energy inputs from the electrical grid. Hybrid solar panels also provide sufficient energy for operation of an upgrading system to obtain biomethane of fuel vehicle quality, increasing the energy self-sufficiency of the agricultural activities. This solution has been simulated in five different climatic regions corresponding to areas of intense pig farming activity. The results demonstrate the sustainable bioenergy production in isolated farms with limited connection to the energy grid and organic matter availability. Furthermore, the economic study showed that the proposed technology is competitive compared to other technologies in the energy sector. © 2023","Biogas production; Biomethane; Farm self-sufficiency; Hybridization;

Researching best-fit implementations of battery sizing is vital in providing electrification to isolated areas. MATLAB was utilized to determine the battery sizing in a photovoltaic-battery DC off-grid system using a lithiumion degradation model. The system was subjected to various battery and solar array sizes to determine the relationship between sizing and lifetime. Results indicate that the minimum battery size of 22 is appropriate for the system based on the load and solar output to which no blackouts occur with a minimum expected lifetime of 114, 675 hours, or 13.08 years. Furthermore, the correlation between photovoltaics and BESS sizes was observed to ensure maximum battery life and minimal blackouts in off-grid systems. These observations can further sizing application studies, optimal cost research, and islanded DC microgrid potential. © 2022 IEEE.","BESS; Blackout; DC Microgrid; Degradation; Lithium-ion; Off-grid","Battery storage; Lithium; Battery energy storage systems; Blackout; DC microgrid; Degradation model; Islanded microgrid; Lithium ions; Microgrid; Off-grid system; Off-grids; Photovoltaics; Lithium-ion batteries","","","","","University of the Philippines Los Baños","ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The authors acknowledge the support of the University of the Philippines Los Baños.","Vera Y.E.G., Dufo-Lopez R., Bernal-Agustin J.L., Energy management in microgrids with renewable energy sources: A literature review, Appl.

Related research is focused on the implementation of such production systems without paying the necessary attention to the identification of the proper location for the installation of such a system. This chapter attempts to examine whether electricity production systems, based on renewables (PV, wind), in small villages worldwide are sustainable. A multi-criteria methodology for identifying the most appropriate location(s) for installing low-scale RES-based hybrid electricity production systems to cover local energy demands without grid connection is presented here. The selection is initially based on geographical, spatial, and demographical data; also taken into account are optimally combined meteorological data (solar and wind potential), with available resources (in terms of free space and investment costs) and the desired loads.. On top of that, optimization in not only size and operation of the hybrid system, but also in the composition of energy sources mixture, is also performed. Finally, the use of LCA helps to reduce the environmental cost and thus to improve the total sustainability of the applications. In conclusion, this chapter could serve as a policy tool for promoting and generating off-grid electricity at national level, but also as an assessment of autonomous energy production from renewable energy systems for small off-grid settlements, which is deemed viable based on the presented methodology. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Energy system models are the mathematical models, which are built to represent various problems, related to energy as accurately as possible. Most of the world’s energy generation is from fossil fuel, resulting in a continuous depletion of this resource. Production of milk, fruit, and vegetable along with their processing spread over 70% of the population in countries like India. Agricultural produce loses its value in remote areas due to the inadequate preservation facilities available during its storage and transit. At a local village level, this spoilage could be avoided by supplying short-term cooling systems. Since the availability of feedstock and conversion processes are adequate, serious research has to be carried out to ensure a constant flow of energy services by introducing renewable energy-based technologies. In this chapter, a model is proposed for the technoeconomic assessment of a chilling device powered by hybrid renewable energy to satisfy the cooling needs in isolated areas where there is plenty of bioenergy and solar energy resources available. There is no appropriate research available for hybrid energy systems, with the mixture of existing renewable energy resources as reported in this work. To implement renewable energy for a chilling system, a comprehensive study is also required to find a suitable combination of different renewable energy sources to satisfy the cooling requirements in any remote region. The study conducted in the selected regions shows that the recommended milk chilling system with hybrid renewable energy could work with an overall system performance of 0.17-0.195 and a low payback period of 4.6-5.4 years, besides a positive net present value. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Various risk indicators of SHS, Solar-Diesel Hybrid Mini-grid, Biogas Plant and Wind Turbine are analysed and then ranked. An integrated Best Worst Method (BWM) and weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) method is proposed to select the best renewable energy technology based on risk indicators. At first, nine (9) risk indicators were selected based on literature review and experts' opinion. Then, BWM was deployed to find the weights of the risk indicators. Finally, a Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method, named WASPAS, was applied to select the optimum renewable energy technology for the study area. The results revealed that the SHS is the best technology. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to check the consistency of the rank order.

The main hybridizing challenges are reliability, investment and operating costs, and carbon emissions problems. Since HPS are usually sized to provide energy continuously, it is essential to use the solar energy potential close to full capacity, especially on cloudy days. One of the prominent solutions to overcome these challenges is integrating solar tracking systems (STS). This article focuses on the optimal sizing of HPS based on PV-DG-ESS utilizing STS by analyzing technical, economic, and environmental aspects. Optimization is performed with the MILP solved via Gurobi, considering the net present cost (NPC) and loss of power supply probability (LPSP) objectives. The results indicate that horizontal and dual solar trackers can provide up to 50% better energy harvest performance and reduce NPC by up to 7%. It is also found that there is no significant difference in cost reduction between both systems. Moreover, STS is feasible if the cost is less than 375 USD and 250 USD for Sudan and South Sudan, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Energy efficiency; Hybrid power system; Optimal sizing; Sensitivity analysis; Solar tracking system","South Sudan; Cost reduction; Economic analysis; Energy efficiency; Integer programming; Investments; Operating costs; Rural areas; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Tracking (position); Diesel generators; Energy; Hybrid power; Hybrid power system; Net present cost; Optimal sizing; Photovoltaics; Solar tracker; Solar tracking systems; Storage systems; assessment method; electrification; energy efficiency; energy storage; photovoltaic system; rural electrification; solar power; tracking; Sensitivity analysis","","","","","","","Ayodele E., Misra S., Damasevicius R., Maskeliunas R., Hybrid microgrid for microfinance institutions in rural areas – a field demonstration in West Africa, Sustain.

Alternatively, this system can be used to recover energy from wastewater from industry. The operation and role of the parameters that can influence the value of the rotation speed of the drive system are analyzed through a simulation, maintaining a constant speed in the case of the prototype is achieved through the control system because in real situations the temperature of heat sources can vary within certain limits. The models and tests performed highlight the parameters of the analyzed drive system and the limits of the range in which its speed can vary. © 2021 by the authors.

The combination of conventional power plants (diesel generators) with renewable energy (photovoltaic and wind turbine) power plants is expected to solve the problem of electricity service in isolated areas in southern Tulungagung regency, namely residential area in Brumbun Beach. The existence of government assistance in the form of solar panels distributed to each family head still can not optimize the utilization of electrical energy for 24 h in a day, this is because the generation of diesel generators and solar panels are done separately. This research focuses on the design and analysis of renewable autonomous power supply system which consists of centralized solar-powered diesel generator (solar panel – wind turbine – diesel generator) systems using HOMER software. This software is in addition to being used to create designs, is also capable of performing the most optimal system design evaluation by sorting based on overall cost, basic electricity tariff, and carbon dioxide gas emissions. The research from the design of four power plant configurations shows that the use of 10 kW diesel generators, 8 kW solar panels, and 6 kW wind turbines is the best solution, from the combination of the three energy sources shows the net present cost value of US $ 44,680, Cost of Energy of 0.268 kWh/$, CO2 emissions of 1,077 kg/year, and diesel generator use only 54 min a day. © 2020, Econjournals.

This paper presents a design approach for a wind turbine (WT)/hydrogen HMS with eight alternative small horizontal-axis WTs and arrives at a conclusion based on the total annual cost (TAC), cost of energy (COE), and the loss of power supply possibility throughout the project's life cycle. The effect of adding solar panels to the HMS is investigated in different scenarios. The modified bio-inspired optimization algorithm with high efﬁciency is used, and its results are validated using an original particle swarm optimization in different unavailability levels. Owing to a sensitivity analysis that utilized the wind speed, load demand, and interest rate, the potential of the proposed algorithm to achieve the optimal off-grid HMS design was highlighted. Among the investigated systems (more than 16 systems), the Winds WT/hydrogen energy/solar configuration with $11,952 TAC and 0.3458$/kWh COE has the minimum cost while setting the unavailability level to 2%. In addition, the adding of solar panels, variation of small WT models, wind speed, load demand, and interest rate levels have a significant impact on COE value and number of components. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Bio-inspired optimization algorithm;

This study provides a strategic framework to balance the supply and demand fluctuation for RES-based microgrids in an isolated area. By proposing the NILM, the load can be separately monitored for load shedding later when a critical condition occurs. NILM based on Data-Flow Programming (BDT) offers an appropriate NILM method to be applied to isolated areas. The infrastructure needed to implement the proposed method is related to building a monitoring station equipped with a set of computers and sensors so that the NILM algorithm can proceed. The load shedding and load priority algorithm are also presented in this study to achieve customer satisfaction. The method was developed by considering the limitations of infrastructure in communication, transportation, and other technologies in isolated areas. Therefore, it is necessary to have good cooperation between grid operators and consumers so that the proposed method can work properly. © 2022 Regional Energy Resources Information Center (RERIC), Asian Institute of Technology.

However, renewable energy generation also encounters problems such as power quality issues. The intermittency nature of renewable energy resources, such as varying irradiance of solar PV and wind speed of wind energy in an isolated area, has potentially led to voltage fluctuations on the source side and generate harmonic distortion due to the inverter switching process. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the power quality issues of a standalone solar photovoltaic/microhydro/wind energy system. This study adopts an off-grid solar photovoltaic/micro-hydro system in Teluk Sumbang, East Borneo, Indonesia, as a case study to construct a renewable energy system. For this purpose, voltage fluctuations may vary about ±10% of its nominal value according to IEC standards. Total harmonic distortion (THD) indices according to IEEE standard 519-2014 are used. The simulation model is developed and observed using MATLAB/Simulink environment. A three-phase inverter with closed-loop voltage control insulated gate bipolar transistor inverter is applied to convert DC to AC and supply power to AC loads. LC and LCL filters use to minimize the harmonics distortion injected by the inverter switching process. Results show that under intermittency nature of renewable energy sources leads to power quality issues concerning voltage fluctuation. THD of voltage and current of the systems are less than 8%, and it is still within an acceptable range in IEEE standard limitation. © 2021 IEEE.","micro-hydro; power quality; renewable energy system; solar photovoltaic; wind energy","Electric inverters; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Harmonic analysis; Harmonic distortion; IEEE Standards; MATLAB; Power quality; Quality control; Solar concentrators; Solar power generation; Wind; Harmonics distortion; Intermittency; Inverter switchings; Microhydro; Quality issues; Solar photovoltaics; Solar PVs; Switching process; Total harmonic distortions; Voltage fluctuations; Wind power","","","","","","","Alkahtani A.A., Et al., Power quality in microgrids including supraharmonics: Issues, standards, and mitigations, Ieee Access, 8, pp. 127104-127122, (2020); Qazi A., Et al., Towards sustainable energy: A systematic review of renewable energy sources, technologies, and public opinions, Ieee Access, 7, pp. 63837-63851, (2019); Johansson B., Security aspects of future renewable energy systems-a short overview, Energy, 61, pp. 598-605, (2013); Wardana F.T., Riady T., Hosting capacity analysis for rooftop pv in indonesia: A case study in gayo lues district, aceh, Proc.-2nd Int.

The heat transfer fluid between the thermal loads and the solar collector loop was heating oil. The study provided two thermal loads; solar water heating system and solar baking/cooking system that had experimentally investigated under various weather conditions. The experimental pilot unit was installed in Solar Energy Department, National Research Centre, Giza, Egypt. Several test runs were performed to measure all assigned parameters that affect the system performance. The system is designed to provide high thermal energy through hot oil surrounding the inner vessel of the baker while the raw food can be baked/cooked and the outlet thermal energy can be used for heating water via immersed coil in the hot water storage tank; then the relatively cooled oil is returned to the solar collector via hot oil circulating pump. The water tank heat exchanger is designed with the following design parameters; specific heat of oil and water were 1.67 kJ/kg °C and 4.186 kJ/kg °C respectively; density of oil and water were 850 kg/m3 and 1000 kg/m3 respectively; mass flow rate of oil and water were 12 liters/min and 6 liters/min respectively. It is clear that the system in addition to provide thermal energy for baking/cooking unit, it can provide thermal energy for water heating purposes. The tested system can be positively contributed in baking and cooking purposes and providing hot water as well. It is found that, for the same flow rates of hot oil and water, as the hot oil temperature difference increased, the outlet hot water increased. The system is capable to produce hot water temperature up to 85 °C if the hot oil temperature difference was 100 °C while it can produce hot water temperature about 60 °C if the hot oil temperature difference was 60 °C during the day which is suitable for residential purposes and industrial process as well. Based on the resultant data, it is found that the system solar fraction was estimated as 54%. The auxiliary heating system can be electric source in case of using in urban areas and can be renewable energy source like biogas or hydrogen fuels in rural and isolated areas.  © 2021 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC).","Baking/Cooking; Evacuated tube heat pipe solar collector; Performance evaluation; Solar energy; Water heating; Water heating system","","","","","","National Research Centre, NRC","The Authors acknowledged the National Research Centre for funding the experimental part of this research and facilitated all the required measured data.","Grupp M., Solar cooking - lessons from the past, hopes for future, World renewable energy congress, (1990); Magney GK., Keys to successful solar cooking, ISES World Congress, (1991); Purohit P, Kumar A, Rana S, Kandpal TC., Using renewable energy technologies for domestic cooking in India: a methodology for potential estimation, Renew Energy, 36, (2002); (2003); Pohekar SD, Kumar D, Ramachandran M., Dissemination of cooking energy alternatives in India - a review, Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev, 9, (2005); Kumar S., Estimation of design parameters for thermal performance evaluation of boxtype solar cooker, Renew Energy, 30, (2005); Bernard R., Safe solar cooking, World renewable energy congress, (1990); Annual Report, (1990); Schwarzer K, Krings T, Hafner B., Dissemination of solar cookers with temporary storage - a report of a concrete example: experiences from India and Chile, 2nd world conference on solar cooking, (1994); Haraksingh I, Mc Doom IA, Headley OSC., A natural convection flat-plate collector solar cooker with short term storage, Renew Energy, 9, (1996); Schwarzer K, Silva MEV., Solar cooking systems with or without heat storage for families and institutions, Solar Energy, 75, (2003); Faghri A., Heat pipe science and technology, (1995); Nada S.A., El-Ghetany H.H., Hussein HMS., Performance of a two phase closed thermossyphon flat-plate solar collector with a shell and tubes heat exchanger, Applied Thermal Engineering, 24, (2004); Hussein H.M.S., El-Ghetany H.H., Nada SA., Performance of wickless heat pipe flat plate solar collectors having different pipes cross sections geometries and filling ratios, Energy Convers Manage, 47, (2006); Khalifa AMA, Akyurt M., Taha MMA., Cookers for solar homes, Applied Energy, 24, (1986); Khalifa AMA, Taha MMA, Mannaa A, Akyurt M., A split system solar cooker with heat pipes, Energy Convers Manage, 26, (1986); Stumpf P, Balzar A, Eisenmann W, Wendt S, Ackermann H, Vajen K., Comparative measurements and theoretical modelling of singleand double-stage heat pipe coupled solar cooking systems for high temperatures, Solar Energy, 71, (2001); Hussein H.M.S., El-Ghetany H.H., Nada S.A., Experimental investigation of novel indirect solar cooker with indoor PCM thermal storage and cooking unit, Energy Conversion & Management, 49, pp. 2237-2246, (2008); El-Ghetany H.

Within this context, in this study, the challenges related to microgrids and data analysis are presented, and different relevant data architectures described in the literature are compared. This paper focuses on the design of a data architecture for a smart microgrid for NIZs whose microgrid contains two 260 W solar panels, a 480 W inverter, and two 260 Ah batteries. Regarding the Colombian context, this paper describes the limitations (connectivity, isolation, appropriation of technologies) and opportunities (low demand, access to natural resources, state interest) from which the functional and non-functional requirements for the architecture are established. Finally, a data architecture is proposed and implemented in a NIZ in Colombia, and this paper also includes a description of the architecture, its characteristics, its associated opportunities and challenges, and discussions regarding its implementation. © 2023 by the authors.","big data; data architecture; microgrids; Non-Interconnected Zones (NIZ); smart grid","Architecture; Microgrids; Smart power grids; Alternative solutions; Case-studies; Colombians; Data architectures; Data-driven architectures; Microgrid; Non-interconnected zone; Renewable energies; Smart grid; Smart Micro Grids; Big data","","","","","Costo Nivelado de Energía, (INV3300); Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia","This work was supported by the project “Desarrollo de una herramienta computacional para la selección de sistemas energéticos optimizados a nivel del Costo Nivelado de Energía (LCoE) para Zonas No Interconectadas de Colombia” via grant number INV3300, funded by Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia under the call 100039 “Proyectos estratégicos con invitación externa 2022”.","Plan Nacional de Desarrollo 2018–2022, (2018); Colmenares-Quintero R.F., Maestre-Gongora G., Baquero-Almazo M., Stansfield K.E., Colmenares-Quintero J.C., Data Analysis of Electricity Service in Colombia’s Non-Interconnected Zones through Different Clustering Techniques, Energies, 15, (2022); (2003); Zhou K., Fu C., Yang S., Big Data Driven Smart Energy Management: From Big Data to Big Insights, Renew.

However, these areas often face challenges and obstacles in obtaining energy for use in irrigation since many depend on diesel generators (DGs) to produce electricity. A farm located in a remote area in Al-Jafr, Jordan, uses a 100 kW DG to supply its need for electric energy for irrigation purposes. Its energy consumption is 500 kWh/day at $0.29/kWh. This paper designs a new hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) for this farm by conducting simulations using the HOMER (Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources) software. This new system consists of solar photovoltaics (PVs), batteries, an inverter, and a 100 kW DG. The results showed a clear difference between the baseline DG-only system and the hybrid system regarding energy cost and carbon emissions. The energy price for the HRES is $0.107/kWh, and carbon dioxide emissions are reduced to 27,378 kg/yr from 184,917 kg/yr for the DG-only system. In addition, simulations and comparisons for an alternative HRES with a 60 kW DG were conducted. Based on the simulation results, the energy price was $0.091 instead of $0.19, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were 15,847 kg/yr instead of 115,090 kg/yr. It was concluded that using hybrid renewable energy systems to power the irrigation of remote areas successfully reduced the energy cost, fuel consumption, emissions, and overall cost. The HOMER program makes an accurate comparison over extended periods between the four strategies (load following, cycle charging, combined dispatch, and predictive dispatch) and selects the optimal system based on the cost, emissions, fuel consumption, and percentage of renewable energy from the system.

The key feature of this system is the direct connection of the photovoltaic (PV) array to the drive, eliminating the need for the DC-DC converter. This direct connection simplifies the system architecture, reduces losses, and improves overall performance. The system employs an inverter to control an asynchronous motor, which can be utilized for various applications. In this study, we specifically focus on the pumping application, which is crucial in isolated areas where PV systems are commonly used for water pumping. By utilizing the asynchronous motor, economic control law and eliminating the DC-DC converter, the system achieves increased efficiency and reduced costs, making it a viable solution for remote locations. To track the maximum power available, an MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) algorithm is employed. The algorithm utilizes drive measurements to track and extract the maximum power from the PV array. The used strategy is based on PI controller to regulate the DC bus voltage by changing the motor speed reference.

Indeed, two efficient new control MPPT algorithms presented are based on the Perturb and Observe (P&O) method with a fixed step. The two suggested controllers are Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The first one uses Multilayer perceptron (MLP) learned by Levenberg Marquard (LM) learning algorithm as a neural regulator named (POPI-LMNN). The second one uses an Adaptative linear Neuron type (Adaline) learned by least mean square algorithm (LMS). The controllers are applied to a DC-DC boost converter inside a standalone solar photovoltaic conversion system used to feed an isolated area. As a result, the responses achieved through the learning approaches are more convincing. That is to say, they are faster and more efficient in terms of the power conversion. This is used to override the limitations of the traditional P&O technique, which are the fluctuations around the maximum power point with their low response tracking performance in the most severe cases of changing weather conditions. A comparative study between the three algorithms is done using Matlab/Simulink Simpower system environment. The results of simulation demonstrate that the Adaline presents a very high performance in terms of rapidity and elimination of oscillations with a conserving energy. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Adaline; Boost converter; MLP; MPPT; P&O; Solar PV simulator","DC-DC converters; MATLAB; Maximum power point trackers; Multilayer neural networks; DC-DC boost converters; Least mean square algorithms; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Multi layer perceptron; Simulation and analysis; Simulation demonstrate; Solar photovoltaic system; Stand-alone PV systems; Learning algorithms","","","","","","","Lasheen M., Abdel-Salam M., Maximum power point tracking using Hill Climbing and ANFIS techniques for PV applications: a review and a novel hybrid approach, Energy Con.

The indispensable legislative and regulatory, while also the necessary technological, societal and behavioral developments in order to support the energy transition will require public understanding and ownership to deliver their full potential. The main discussion is how to enable low-carbon energy transitions based on renewable-energy technologies such as wind turbines, solar panels, biogas plants or geothermal plants. Digitalization of energy and distributed storage are shaping the future of electricity use. Micro Grids (MG) on the other hand represent the means by which the purpose will be achieved. In Tilos island Technology Innovation for the Local Scale Optimum Integration of Battery Energy Storage (TILOS) case, it has been identified that the Quadruple Helix's (QH) components are accelerating the transfer of research and innovation results to regional growth while stressing the replicating potentials. Taking into consideration all parameters involved, while learning from pioneers' evidence, low-carbon energy transition and energy supply for isolated areas can be achieved. Finally the energy ecosystem space metamorphosis creates the new emerging structures and norms. © 2019","Energy storage; Islands; Quadruple helix; Renewable energy sources; Smart microgrids; Socio-technical transition","Carbon; Electric energy storage; Electronic properties; Energy storage; Engineering research; Wind turbines; Islands; Micro grid; Quadruple helices; Renewable energy source; Socio-technical transitions; alternative energy; biogas; carbon emission; digitization; emission control; energy planning; energy storage; innovation; island; metamorphosis; public attitude; smart grid; technological development; Geothermal energy","","","","","","","Cherpa A., Vinichenko V., Jewell J., Brutschin E., Sovacool B., Integrating techno-economic, socio-technical and political perspectives on national energy transitions: a meta-theoretical framework, Energy Res.

Such analysis must also consider the uncertainty of several factors such as fuel prices, the cost and performance of renewable and conventional power generation technologies, and the value of environmental benefits. This paper presents a method for this analysis, making two main contributions to the literature. First, it shows how to characterize the two alternatives (i.e., main-grid extension vs. local power generation) in detail for precise quantification of their capital and operating costs while guaranteeing that they are both adequate to meet forecast demand and operating reserves. Second, it shows how to properly account for the economic and environmental implications of renewable energy intermittency and uncertainty through the optimization of capital investments and hourly operations. The method is illustrated by applying this analysis method to Saudi Arabia, where the government is struggling to outline a strategy to meet residential and commercial loads reliably and sustainably in the country’s remote, scattered, isolated areas. To meet this demand, the Saudi government is considering two main alternatives: (1) extending the primary power transmission grid; or (2) installing an optimal combination of off-grid distributed generation (DG) resources, including solar PV, wind, diesel, oil, heavy fuel oil, and Li-ion batteries, to generate the electricity locally. Results suggest that under most scenarios of capital costs, fuel prices, and costs of air pollution, developing a microgrid with a large share of wind and solar power is more cost-effective than extending a primary grid 150 km or more away. Extending a primary grid powered by gas-fired combined-cycle power plants is more economical only if the load is not very high, the distance is not more than 350 km, and oil prices are relatively high compared to natural gas. © 2023 by the authors.","batteries; capacity expansion planning; distributed generation; emissions; energy access; microgrid; renewable; rural electricity; solar PV; wind power","Combined cycle power plants; Cost benefit analysis; Distributed power generation; Economic analysis; Electric lines; Electric loads; Environmental technology; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas plants; Investments; Lithium-ion batteries; Operating costs; Rural areas; Solar energy; Uncertainty analysis; Wind power; Battery; Capacity expansion planning; Emission; Energy access; Grid extension; Microgrid; Renewable; Rural electricities; Solar PVs; Uncertainty; Electric power transmission","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (SES-0949710)","This research received funding from the Center for Climate and Energy Decision Center, funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (SES-0949710).","Report: Universal Access to Sustainable Energy Will Remain Elusive Without Addressing Inequalities, (2021); Thushara D.S.M., Hornberger G.M., Baroud H., Decision analysis to support the choice of a future power generation pathway for Sri Lanka, Appl.

To investigate this effect in future studies, it is necessary to quantitatively describe the crack features (e.g., length) and correlate them with module power loss. Electroluminescence (EL) imaging is a common technique for identifying cracks. However, it is currently challenging and time-consuming to identify cracks in a large number of EL images and quantify complex crack features by human inspection. This article introduces a fast semantic segmentation method (∼0.18 s/cell) to automatically segment cracks from EL images and algorithms to extract crack features. We fine-tuned a UNet neural network model using pretrained VGG16 as the encoder and obtained an average F1 score of 0.875 and an intersection over union score of 0.782 on the testing set. With cracks and busbars segmented, we developed algorithms for extracting crack features, including the crack-isolated area, the brightness inside the isolated area, and the crack length. We also developed an automatic preprocessing tool for cropping individual cell images from EL images of PV modules (∼0.72 s/module). Our codes are published as open-source an software, and our annotated dataset composed of various types of cells is published as a benchmark for crack segmentation in EL images.  © 2011-2012 IEEE.","Crack feature extraction; deep learning; photovoltaic (PV) module; semantic segmentation","Edge detection; Electroluminescence; Extraction; Feature extraction; Open source software; Open systems; Photoelectrochemical cells; Photovoltaic effects; Semantics; Solar panels; Solar power generation; Annotation; Crack feature extraction; Deep learning; Features extraction; Image edge detection; Images segmentations; Photovoltaic modules; Semantic segmentation; Strip; Image segmentation","","","","","","","Ardani K., Et al., Solar futures study, (2021); Aghaei M., Et al., Review of degradation and failure phenomena in photovoltaic modules, Renewable Sustain.

The insect pest complex of potato is characterized by a high degree of plasticity and adaptability. In particular, the Colorado potato beetle quickly expanded its host range to include cultivated potato and has shown a remarkable ability to evolve resistance to a wide variety of chemicals. Another major pest of potatoes, the green peach aphid, is also very adaptable to insecticides. Both of these insects can also develop resistance to nonchemical methods of their suppression, such as biological control and crop rotation. In addition, understanding insect adaptation to abiotic conditions (temperature, water availability, solar irradiation, etc.) is essential for forecasting future pest outbreaks under the current conditions of extensive human traffic among previously geographically isolated areas and changing climate. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Tele-healthcare system using digital technologybased telemedicine is widely used across various medical specialties. To solve limitation of medical resources in hospital located in remote isolated areas, telehealthcare system using smart application has been applied to access expert opinions in pre-coronavirus disease (COVID-19) era since 2017. The COVID-19 has spread also in this island during COVID-19 period. We have experienced three consecutive neuroemergency patients. Their ages and final diagnoses were: 98 years with subdural hematoma (case 1), 76 years with post-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (case 2), and 65 years with cerebral infarction (case 3), respectively. The tele-counseling could save two of three transportations to tertiary hospital and also save 6,000 US dollars per case for transportation by helicopter. From these three cases counseled through smart app which has been started to use 2 years before COVID-19 emerged in 2020, what this case series would report are the following two viewpoints: (1) medicoeconomic benefits exist in tele-healthcare system in COVID-19 era and (2) developing telehealthcare systems must be prepared that is available even when the electricity system has been shut down, for instance solar system that could. This system must be developed when non-disaster period for disaster days of natural disasters and human-related disasters including wars and terrorisms. © 2023 Published by Scientific Scholar on behalf of Journal of Neurosciences in Rural Practice.","COVID-19; Disaster; Tele-healthcare","tissue plasminogen activator; aged; air medical transport; Article; brain infarction; case report; clinical article; comparative study; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cost control; digital technology; disease course; e-counseling; economic evaluation; elective surgery; electricity; emergency surgery; female; health care access; health care cost; health care system; human; magnetic resonance angiography; male; medical literature; natural disaster; neurosurgery; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pandemic; patient transport; rural area; subarachnoid hemorrhage; subdural hematoma; telecare; telemedicine; tertiary care center; thrombectomy; very elderly","","tissue plasminogen activator, 105913-11-9","","","","","Amagai T, Ichimaru S, Tai M, Ejiri Y, Muto A., Nutrition in the great East Japan earthquake disaster, Nutr Clin Pract, 29, pp. 585-594, (2014); Bitar H, The role of eHealth, telehealth, and telemedicine for chronic disease patients during COVID-19 pandemic: A rapid systematic review, Digit Health, 7, (2021); Saiegh FA, Mouchtouris N, Khanna O, Baldassari M, Theofanis T, Ghosh R, Et al., Battle-Tested guidelines and operational protocols for neurosurgical practice in times of a pandemic: Lessons learned from COVID-19, World Neurosurg, 146, pp. 20-25, (2021); Blue R, Ayang AI, Zhou C, De Ravin E, Teng CW, Arguelles GR, Et al., Telemedicine in the era of coronavirus disease 2019: A neurosurgical perspective, World Neurosurg, 139, pp. 549-557, (2020)","T.

However, the increasing cost and harmful emissions of these fuels have led researchers to seek alternative solutions in providing electricity. Hence, harnessing renewable resources can be a favourable solution in lowering the dependency on fossil fuels. The Strait of Malacca is blessed with tidal current energy, a research was conducted to design a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) that consists of tidal current and solar energy as its sources along with backup power such as generators to support the electrical demand of a lighthouse. A simulation method is used to determine and compare the optimal configuration of the HRES with the diesel generator-based system. An evaluation of all possible scenarios of standalone systems was carried out by considering the amount of fuel consumption and pollutant emittance, capacity shortage, excess electricity production, unmet energy and renewable fraction parameters of each system scenario. From the findings, the hybrid energy system of Scenario A that consists of tidal turbines, PVs, generator, battery, and converter produces better results where the diesel fuel consumption can be reduced up to 84% in comparison with the standalone generator-based system. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","","Diesel engines; Ocean currents; Solar energy; Tidal stream; Alternative solutions; Electricity supply; Energy systems; Generation systems; Harmful emissions; Hybrid power; Hybrid renewable energies; Increasing costs; Renewable resource; Small scale; Fossil fuels","","","","","Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, UTM, (Q.K130000.3556.06G45, Q.K130000.3601.03M09)","This work is supported by Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), Malaysia under Research University Grant Q.K130000.3601.03M09 and Grant Q.K130000.3556.06G45 for the financial support provided throughout this research project.","Al-Falahi M.D., Jayasinghe S.D.G., Enshaei H.J.E.C., Energy Convers.

In isolated areas where access to the grid is limited or restricted, a stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) system is particularly effective. In such a system, the available electrical energy mainly depends on the solar irradiance and the capacities of the PV array and battery. In this paper, we develop an optimization method for designing a residential off-grid PV system. The method determines the number of PV panels and battery modules for cost-effectively operating the system. We use a mixed-integer programming model to pre-schedule the daily usage of appliances according to a forecasted solar irradiance. The schedule is then executed on a Monte Carlo simulation that considers the uncertainty of the solar irradiance. An integer Nelder-Mead (N-M) algorithm determines the size of the PV-Battery system. The performance of the method is measured using plane of irradiance data at two locations in the USA. We perform a sensitivity analysis by changing the cost of the battery and the penalty cost of non-served energy. In addition, we investigate the effects of scheduling, forecast solar irradiance variability, and battery degradation. © 2020 International Solar Energy Society","Battery capacity; Integer Nelder-Mead algorithm; Off-grid PV system; PV array capacity","United States; Cost benefit analysis; Electric batteries; Housing; Monte Carlo methods; Photovoltaic cells; Sensitivity analysis; Solar radiation; Battery degradation; Battery systems; Electrical energy; Mixed integer programming model; Optimization method; Photovoltaic systems; Solar irradiance variability; Solar irradiances; algorithm; array; equipment; operations technology; optimization; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; solar radiation; Integer programming","","","","","","","Ahmad G.E., Photovoltaic-powered rural zone family house in Egypt, Renew.

Genetic algorithms (GA) have shown their capability to solve different optimization problems and also their superiority to many other methods. In this paper, a GA-based MPPT algorithm is implemented to extract the maximum power from an off-grid PV system. To convert the generated DC power from the PV arrays into adequate AC power to supply different types of loads, a double-stage power conversion topology is adopted. A DC-DC boost converter is firstly, connected to the terminals of the PV modules. The GAbased MPPT algorithm is, thereafter, implemented to adjust the duty cycle of the boost converter in a way to achieve MPP operation of the PV modules. Then, a stand-alone PV inverter is connected in cascade with the boost converter to feed the AC loads. A numerical model of the whole PV conversion platform is developed using Matlab/Simulink software. Thereafter, different simulation tests are performed considering a real case of an off-grid PV installation located in the city of Mzaougha, Monastir (Tunisia) in an isolated area from distribution grid of the national company of electricity. An adequate PV module, which satisfies the energetic needs of the site is also selected and its real model is used for simulations. The obtained results confirm the feasibility of the proposed technique and its effectiveness in controlling an off-grid PV system. © 2023 IEEE.","boost converter; Genetic Algorithm; MPPT; Off-grid PV system; optimization; stand-alone inverter","Boost converter; Electric inverters; Electric loads; Electric power distribution; MATLAB; Maximum power point trackers; Solar panels; Solar power generation; BOOST converter; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Maximum Power Point Tracking algorithms; Off-grid photovoltaic system; Off-grids; Optimisations; Photovoltaic modules; Photovoltaic systems; Stand -alone; Stand-alone inverte; Genetic algorithms","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, Republic of Sudan, MHESR, (LATIS – ENISO, LabEM – ESSTHSousse – LR11ES34); Université de Sousse, Uso","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research project was supported by the Tunisian Ministry of High Education and Scientific Research under Grant LATIS – ENISO and Grant LabEM – ESSTHSousse – LR11ES34, University of Sousse.","Motahhir S., El Hammoumi A., El Ghzizal A., The most used MPPT algorithms: Review and the suitable low-cost embedded board for each algorithm, J Clean Prod, 246, (2020); Salman S., Ai X., Wu Z., Design of a P-&-O algorithm based MPPT charge controller for a stand-alone 200W PV system, Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems, 3, 1, (2018); Suwannatrai P., Liutanakul P., Wipasuramonton P., Maximum power point tracking by incremental conductance method for photovoltaic systems with phase shifted full-bridge dc-dc converter, ECTI-CON 2011-8th Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology (ECTI) Association of Thailand-Conference 2011, pp. 637-640, (2011); Baba A.O., Liu G., Chen X., Classification and Evaluation Review of Maximum Power Point Tracking Methods, Sustainable Futures, 2, (2020); Merchaoui M., Hamouda M., Sakly A., Mimouni M.F., Fuzzy logic adaptive particle swarm optimisation based MPPT controller for photovoltaic systems, Iet Renewable Power Generation, 14, 15, pp. 2933-2945, (2020); Albadr M.A., Tiun S., Ayob M., Al-Dhief F., Genetic Algorithm Based on Natural Selection Theory for Optimization Problems, Symmetry (Basel), 12, 11, (2020); Rocke D.M., Michalewicz Z., Genetic Algorithms + Data Structures = Evolution Programs, J Am Stat Assoc, 95, 449, (2000); Patra B., Nema P., Khan M.Z., Khan O., Optimization of solar energy using MPPT techniques and industry 4.0 modelling, Sustainable Operations and Computers, 4, pp. 22-28, (2023); Kramer O., Genetic algorithms, Studies in Computational Intelligence, 679, pp. 11-19, (2017); Hassanat A., Almohammadi K., Alkafaween E., Abunawas E., Hammouri A., Prasath V.B.S., Choosing Mutation and Crossover Ratios for Genetic Algorithms-A Review with a New Dynamic Approach, Information, 10, 12, (2019); Katoch S., Chauhan S.S., Kumar V., A review on genetic algorithm: Past, present, and future, Multimed Tools Appl, 80, 5, pp. 8091-8126, (2021)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2023 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Green Energy, ICAIGE 2023","12 October 2023 through 14 October 2023","Sousse","195506","","979-835032553-9","","","English","IEEE Int.

Samples from the affected monocrystalline silicon cells are cored and extracted from the module packaging and then laser-scribed to form 2-mm diameter isolated areas. Using deep-level transient spectroscopy, a majority-carrier, hole-trap defect with an activation energy of 0.42 eV is detected on degraded and regenerated samples. The LeTID-degraded sample, however, has a larger signal corresponding to a trap density of 1.1 × 1013 cm-3, which is about five times larger than the 2.1 × 1012 cm-3 trap density of the regenerated sample. An increase in filling pulse time from 50 μs to 20 ms shows a slight decrease in activation energy from 0.42 to 0.36 eV suggesting that the defect level may consist of a band of energy states where shallower states continue to fill with long filling times. The capture rate of the defect is directly measured using an increasing series of filling pulsewidths in 15 to 125 ns range. This leads to a measured capture cross section of 5.1 × 10-17 cm2, and using an approximate defect density of 1013 cm-3, the majority-carrier-hole lifetime related to this defect is approximately 100 μs when in the LeTID-degraded state.  © 2011-2012 IEEE.","Charge carrier lifetime; degradation; laser ablation; photovoltaic cells; semiconductor impurities; solar panels","Activation energy; Carrier lifetime; Deep level transient spectroscopy; Filling; Monocrystalline silicon; Photoelectrochemical cells; Semiconductor lasers; Silicon solar cells; Solar cells; Charge carrier lifetime; Deep levels transient spectroscopy; Elevated temperature; Induced degradation; Lasers ablations; Majority carriers; Semiconductor impurity; Silicon cells; Solar panels; Temperature-induced; Laser ablation","","","","","","","Ramspeck K., Et al., Light induced degradation of rear passivated mc-Si solar cell, Proc. 27th Eur.

It represents a clean source of energy, available with abundant quantities with very good average daily solar radiation of about 5.5 kW h/m2/day. The present work provides a comprehensive study for a complete design of the solar pumping system components with different water demands. A computer program is designed and developed to offer the system design and the solar simulation model is presented. The hydraulic power, photovoltaic (PV) peak power, PV required area, and total system costs for different total dynamic heads and different water demands ranged from 1–1000 m3/day are calculated. The present research is a good tool for designers, users, and buyers of such systems. It is found that the PV solar water pumping system is more economically feasible than diesel generators up to a water demand of 100 m3/day. The model is a needed tool for all concerned in the field of PV solar water pumping including costumers. © 2020, Allerton Press, Inc.","design tool; efficiency; PV sizing; solar water pumping system; water demand","Diesel engines; Pumping plants; Comprehensive designs; Daily solar radiations; Diesel generators; Hydraulic power; Simulation model; Solar pumping systems; Source of energy; Total dynamic heads; Pumps","","","","","Mechanical Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering; Solar Energy Department; National Research Centre, NRC; Al-Azhar University","The authors would like to acknowledge the Mechanical Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, Al-Azhar University, Egypt and the Solar Energy Department, National Research Centre, Egypt for providing the facilities to perform this research.","Raturi A., Feasibility study of a solar water pumping system, Appl.

HPS utilizes renewable energy as the main source combined with a diesel engine generator as a backup energy source. The renewable energy used can come from solar energy, wind energy, and others. Sebotok Village, located in Labuhan Badas sub-district, Sumbawa regency, West Nusa Tenggara province, is an isolated area that uses 4 diesel generator units as a source of electricity generation. The purpose of this research is to identify potential renewable energy resources (wind and solar) and to develop a design and analysis of the economic feasibility of HPS in the region. The design feasibility analysis of the Hybrid Power Plant was carried out using the Hybrid Optimization Model of Electric Renewables (HOMER Energy) simulation. This system is a combination of Wind/PV//Diesel, battery, DC/DC converter, and DC/AC inverter. The simulation results show the configuration of 160 kW PV, 160 kW PV Inverter, 100 kW diesel generator, 24 battery units, and 10 kW Converter with a dispatch strategy of load following. The configuration has the lowest Cost of Energy (COE) value of 0.139 kWh and the lowest Total Net Present Cost (NPC) of 1.06 Million. Meanwhile, the sensitivity simulation shows that the COE value is most influenced by the price of diesel fuel, the cost of PV, and solar radiation, respectively. © 2021 IEEE.","Cost of Energy; Homer Energy; Hybrid Power System; Net Present Cost","DC-DC converters; Diesel engines; Electric batteries; Electric inverters; Electric power plants; Intelligent systems; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Wind power; Backup energy sources; Diesel engine generators; Economic feasibilities; Electricity generation; Fossil energy sources; Hybrid power systems (HPS); Renewable energy potentials; Sensitivity Simulation; Electric load dispatching","","","","","","","Handayani N.A., Et al., Potency of solar energy applications in indonesia, International Journal of Renewable Energy Development (IJRED), (2012); Rencana Usaha Penyediaan Tenaga Listrik (RUPTL)PT Pln (Persero) 2019-2028, (2019); Lazarov V.D., Norton G., Zarkov Z., Bochev I., Hybrid power systems with renewable energy sources types, structures, trends for research and development, M: Proc of International Conference Elma, pp. 515-520, (2005); Pohmeni S., Moretti L., Manzolini G., Leva S., Meraldi L., Raboni P., Numerical and experimental testing of predictive ems algorithms for pv-bess residential microgrid, Proceedings of the 2019 Ieee Milan PowerTech, pp. 1-6, (2009); Leva S., Zaninelli D., Hybrid renewable energy-fuel cell system: Design and performance evaluation, Electr.

As the space exploration will guide us further away from Earth, delay will impact real time interaction and tele operated systems will no longer be usable. Our objective was to design a solution which allows a novice to locate the probe on the acoustic window and to get a medically usable view of any organ without any assistance. Our solution uses an augmented reality application to assist the novice operator in performing an echography. Before flight, the software enables an expert sonographer to save the cartesian probe coordinates corresponding to the perfect position and orientation of an ultrasound probe to get the perfect 2D echographic image of an organ. In-flight, the novice operator is able to retrieve the probe's position registered preflight thanks to an augmented reality visualization on the subject body. The protocol has been tested on a 3-day parabolic flight campaign. The solution allowed to find the AW in 88% and a 2D image in 82% of the 34 organs investigated. This tool will allow a reliable ultrasound medical surveillance during long distance space trip with no realtime link with earth. Its usage may be extended to isolated areas and medical deserts that cannot benefit from the precious tool that is ultrasonography.

Shortage of freshwater resources at remote and rural areas is limiting population settlement and development. Therefore, it is necessary to find alternative solutions including saline water desalination processes to assist obtaining fresh water for domestic and industrial purposes in these remote areas. The energy needed for the desalination process represents another challenge due to the available fossil fuel limitation, increasing prices and their negative impacts on the environment. These challenges may be tackled by applying hybrid renewable energy (RE) resources such as solar and wind energies as the driving power for the desalination technologies. Many studies are conducted in Egypt, Middle East region and worldwide investigating the possibilities of different desalination systems driven by RE. This article presents a recent review of the global desalination processes with a focus on membrane desalination systems such as reverse osmosis (RO), membrane distillation (MD), hybrid desalination technologies and processes as well as advanced plasmonic nanomaterials for water distillation derived by RE suitable for remote and isolated areas. Some recent activities for coupling desalination systems with hybrid RE carried-out by the co-authors will be highlighted.  © The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Distillation; Distilleries; Fossil fuels; Saline water; Water filtration; Alternative solutions; Desalination technologies; Fresh water resources; Hybrid renewable energies; Membrane desalination; Membrane distillation; Saline water desalinations; Solar and wind energies; Desalination","","","","","Egyptian Academy of Scientic Research and Technology; European Frame-Work Projects; STIFA, (26214); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7; Sixth Framework Programme, FP6; British Council, (216423297); European Commission, EC; Academy of Scientific Research and Technology, ASRT; Science and Technology Development Fund, STDF","Funding text 1: The nancial support of the British Council (Project ID: 216423297 – Egypt) in the UK and the Science and Technology Development Fund (STDF) (Currently known as Science, Technology and Innovation Funding Authority – STIFA) (Project ID: 26214) in Egypt is gratefully acknowledged.; Funding text 2: City for Scientic Research Technological Applications (SRTA-City) in Borg El-Arab, Egypt is holding several research projects that are related to desalination and RE.

Rapid growth of renewable sources has led to telecom operators concentrating more on designing the system with appropriate energy storage elements, providing control facilities, improving system efficiency and verifying uninterrupted power supplies. Therefore, this paper gives a novel approach of utilizing embedded control in energy generation consisting of a solar-wind hybrid energy system placed in isolated areas. For the purpose of integration of wind, together with the solar energy sources, into an increasingly efficient system, a single Cuk-Luo integrated DC-DC converter has been put forward. The proposed system has been modeled using MATLAB/Simulink and verified under various combinations of solar-wind energy sources without compromising the required power. In order to verify the proposed Cuk-Luo integrated converter with the energy management controller system, a prototype hardware is implemented and tested. © 2023 by the authors.","Cuk-Luo integrated DC-DC converter; embedded controller; energy management system; telecom","","","","","","Taif University, TU, (TURSP-2020/121)","The authors would like to acknowledge the support received by Taif University Researchers Supporting Project number (TURSP-2020/121), Taif University, Taif, Saudi Arabia.

The use of solar distillation is used to treat the wastewater as an alternative to the fresh water sources. Thus, this study will determine the water quality of two different wastewater using solar water distiller and evaluates whether the treated water comply to the standard limit of drinking water from the Ministry of Health, Malaysia (MOH). The stormwater and greywater were used as water samples for the study. The physical properties investigated were temperature, colour, and odour while the chemical properties were total dissolved solids (TDS), ammonia, chlorine, hardness and pH value. The performance of solar water distiller was examined by considering the quality as well as the quantity of treated water. The relationship between the surrounding temperature, humidity and the volume of water collected was observed and recorded. The physicochemical parameters of the water after the treatment lies within the standard of MOH. Thus, the results demonstrated that the solar water distiller has potential as an alternative sustainable water treatment method. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","","","","Baker B H., Omer A, Aldridge C A., Water Availability and Use, Water Resour.

On these farms, milk is stored in plastic containers, resulting in post-production losses estimated at 10% in the studied region. Due to high temperatures, the present paper aims to study the implementation of an innovative solar-powered milk cooling system in Central Tunisia and assess its profitability for dairy farmers. The methodology is based on a comparison of three small-scale farm business models: a farm without any milk cooling equipment, a farm using an innovative milk cooling technology, and a farm using an electrical cooling tank. Results showed the significance of milk cooling in reducing milk rejection to 0%, leading to a total production of 6400 L per cow by the fifth year. Additionally, milk sales were found to increase due to the premium of 0.010 TND/L for cooled milk paid. In addition, farms utilizing solar-powered milk cooling technology exhibited superior profitability in terms of financial indicators. This research offers a sustainable energy solution for milk cooling on small farms, specifically addressing the challenges faced by these farms located in isolated areas where access to electricity is limited and the availability of milk cooling equipment is lacking. © 2023 by the authors.","business model; electricity; milk cooling; small-scale farms; solar energy; Tunisia","Cooling; Dairies; Farms; Plastic containers; Profitability; Business models; Central tunisia; Cooling equipment; Cooling technology; Dairy farms; Milk cooling; Small scale; Small-scale farm; Solar-powered; Tunisia; Solar energy","","","","","German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development; Bundesministerium für Wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung, BMZ, (200038)","This material is based upon work supported by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ—https://www.bmz.de/en) under a grant agreement with the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA—http://www.icarda.org) (# agreement no 200038) within the framework of the CGIAR Research Program on Livestock (Livestock CRP—https://livestock.cgiar.org/).","Soethoudt H., Blom G., Axmann H., Dairy Value Chain in Tunisia, Business Opportunities, (2018); Chebbi H.E., Pellissier J.P., Khechimi W., Rolland J.P., Rapport de Synthèse sur L’agriculture en Tunisie, (2019); Zlaoui M., Dhraief M.Z., Dhehibi B., Rekik M., Tunisian Consumer Quality Perception and Preferences for Dairy Products: Do Health and Sustainability Matter?, Sustainability, 13, (2021); Torres V., Salvatierra A., Mrabet F., Muller J., Dairy value chains supported by Solar!

In its intermittency characteristics, it is often forfeiting its energy storage lifespan due to significant charge and discharge amount of power to the energy storage. To resolve the problem, this research proposed an evaluation for a design of wind turbine penetration in standalone photovoltaic system using hybrid storage system (battery and supercapacitor), remembering the intermittency of its source has complementary characteristics in a remote area, when the solar is out of reach, the wind could give the peak contribution. This research provides the wind turbine penetration stability performance and the effect for the system. From the results, the characteristics obtained that after the penetration of wind turbine, the penetration affected the photovoltaic, in both current and power by the decrease of 2,357% and reached its steady state in 0,066 s and 0,034 s respectively. For the load, the penetration affected by increasing the power at 5,095% and back to its normal state at 0,049 s. Meanwhile for the supercapacitor and battery, the steady-state time after the penetration is 0,113 and 0,117 respectively, and also the energy storage proven to be the compensator for the oscillation effect after the penetration. © 2022 IEEE.","Hybrid Storage; Penetration; Stability Performance; Standalone Photovoltaic; Wind Turbine","Energy storage; Power quality; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Solar power generation; Stability; Supercapacitor; Hybrid storage systems; Hybrid storages; Intermittency; Penetration; Photovoltaics; Power; Power stability; Renewable energy source; Stability performance; Standalone photovoltaic; Wind turbines","","","","","","","Harrouz M.A., Abbes M., Colak I., Kayisli K., Smart grid and renewable energy in Algeria, 2017 Ieee 6th International Conference on Renewable Energy Research and Applications (ICRERA, pp. 1166-1171, (2017); Jirjees M.A., Al-Nimma D.A., Al-Hafidh M.S.M., Voltage Stability Enhancement based on Voltage Stability Indices Using FACTS Controllers, 2018 International Conference on Engineering Technology and Their Applications (IICETA, pp. 141-145, (2018); Vallejos W.D.P., Standalone Wind Turbine system, using a single stage boost DC/AC power inverter controlled by a double loop control, 2017 Ieee Pes Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference-Latin America (ISGT Latin America, pp. 1-6, (2017); Setya Budi A.L., Soeprijanto A., Ashari S.M., Pamuji F.A., Standalone Wind Turbine Power Stability Based on Battery and Supercapacitor Hybrid System, (2021); Mars R., Bouzidi B., Yangui A., On the comparison of two hybrid energy storage systems: Parallel connection of battery-RC ultracapacitor/-multibranch ultracapacitor circuits, 2016 Eleventh International Conference on Ecological Vehicles and Renewable Energies (EVER, pp. 1-8, (2016); Ernadi D.A., Pujiantara M., Purnomo M.H., Desain Maximum Power Point Tracking untuk Turbin Angin Menggunakan Modified Perturb & Observe (P&O) Berdasarkan Prediksi Kecepatan Angin, 2016 Jurnal Teknik Its, pp. 265-271, (2016); Budi Setya L.S.A., Ashari M., Ridho H., Pamuji F.A., Implementation of Maximum Power Point Tracking Based on Perturb and Observe Algorithm for Photovoltaic, Wind Turbine, and Fuel Cell Hybrid System, 2020 International Seminar on Application for Technology of Information and Communication (ISemantic, pp. 267-273, (2020); Pilakkat D., Kanthalakshmi S., An improved P&O algorithm integrated with artificial bee colony for photovoltaic systems under partial shading conditions, Sol.

On-grid photovoltaic installations supply energy to consumers as a support energy source, but in isolated areas, it comes as the unique source. The decision-maker must dimension the installation, maintaining system performance with reasonable investments. In some scenarios, the utility manager can handle the energy delivered to consumers as every subsystem can be independently connected. A strategy for scheduling the energy consumption to decrease the number of photovoltaic modules required in a standalone system is proposed here. The problem formulation corresponds to generalising a more specific problem before published.

One of the most promising solutions to address this problem is desalination. Solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation technology has demonstrated that it can be an ideal and clean alternative to fossil fuels, especially in remote and isolated areas where there is no accessibility to power grids, or such accessibility is difficult. The integration of desalination plants with solar PV systems for water production is nearly competitive because of both the decreasing trend of PV prices and the increasing trend of fossil fuel prices over recent years. The generated electricity by PV systems integrated with desalination plants can be utilized to drive electromechanical devices, including pumps and fans, electric heaters, etc., and in a larger range, any direct-current (DC) apparatus. The most mature conventional desalination technologies for integration with solar PV systems are reverse osmosis (RO) and electrodialysis (ED). Due to operating RO based on alternative current (AC), a DC/AC inverter is required while ED systems operate based on DC current. Membrane distillation is another desalination technology that requires thermal power to operate, but PV modules can also be integrated to supply the required electricity for other attached equipment. In addition, the integration of PV modules with solar stills, which are the most favorable alternatives in remote areas for supplying freshwater, has great potential to overcome some of the problems regarding conventional distillation systems. In all mentioned PV-powered desalination systems, energy storage or an electricity back-up system is critical to guarantee sustained operation. The main barrier for worldwide deployment of PV-powered desalination systems is the high investment costs, resulting in high produced water costs. However, there is huge potential for further enhancement of performance, energy savings, and cost reductions. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Solar energy systems usually coordinate integrated energy storage equipment's, normally batteries used to repay the supply demand incongruity due to the characteristic of solar energy. However, the rapid lifespan of batteries rises the operational expenses of solar energy system. The battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system has been proposed by researchers to extend the lifespan of the batteries. This paper analyzed the different types of battery supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS) methodologies and discusses appropriate methods that have improved the lifespan of battery in a stand-alone PV DC mini-grid. Furthermore, the state-of-charge (SoC) characteristics of supercapacitor and battery were determined and compared. © 2022 Author(s).","","","","","","","","","Jing W., Lai C.H., Wong S.H.W., Wong M.L.D., IET Renew.

The SSPV system is more suited for electrification of essential loads uses DC power as it offers high efficiency. This work aims to model and simulate SSPV with lead acid battery is used as a DC source. The proposed series shunt charge controller with power management strategy (PMS)is designed and modeled to control the power flow among SSPV, battery and the load. adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) controller effectively regulates the output voltage by controlling duty ratio of the suitable converter for driving a DC load. A PMS is developed for selecting the operating mode of SSCC by sensing and regulating the battery voltage within 11.6-12.95 V. Here, the 250 Wp panel has been employed to charge a 12 V, 34 AH battery. The practicability of SSPVB system is verified under various loaded conditions using MATLAB/Simulink for a period of 24 hours. A simulation result proves that this SSPV Battery system is capable to electrify the essential loads in rural and isolated areas and also reduce the dependency of grid power. © 2023, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

The EV batteries need to be recharged after a certain amount of driving, and cities make good locations for charging facilities. However, finding a charging infrastructure can be difficult in isolated areas. Large countries including Canada, China, the US, India, Australia, Russia, and a few Arab states are proposing to install pillar top solar panels in remote places for emergency EV charging. This condition requires a specific charging adaptor to monitor the charging current, securely conclude the charging process, and extract the maximum power from the panel utilising MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking). This EV study proposes a sensor-based low-cost charging adapter. MPPT operation and battery charge monitoring should be completed using SIAFL-DO. Only one current sensor-based charging adapters are inexpensive and fast. Furthermore, the SIAFL-DO algorithm accurately executes MPPT and charging management thanks to its excellent condition estimation and decision-making capabilities. This work uses a hardware prototype to assess the adapter&#x0027;s compatibility with the SIAFL-DO algorithm. Additionally, comparison investigations using cutting-edge methods are carried out. The created technique is put to the test against the European Standard EN50530 in order to determine its applicability to the sector.

No. 24885, Safat, 13109, Kuwait","Water scarcity is a global issue recognized by the United Nations under Goal 6 of its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which is to ‘Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all’. This challenging goal requires innovations, especially in areas with freshwater scarcity. Coupling this with the expected significant growth in population, especially in developing countries, presents major challenges to obtaining the appropriate levels of water provision needed. The development of seawater desalination technologies offers hope to alleviate freshwater shortages whilst supporting SDG 6. This research addresses the development of small-scale technology utilizing solar energy for providing clean drinking water in rural, hot, arid, and remote communities. To alleviate water scarcity in rural and isolated areas, a micro solar still (MSS) system that supports a multistage distillation process can be utilized, which evaporates and condenses the saline feed water into pure drinking water with highly efficient solar heat collectors. The focus of this study was to assess the performance of two prototypes, with minor improvements to the wicking structure. Such a system has the advantage of recycling wasted latent heat in the process to increase productivity. Two prototypes were tested to assess the performance of the solar still construction material and yield, and to test the water quality and quantity under the climatic conditions of Kuwait. The operation and efficiency of the prototypes were observed across four characteristics: solar irradiance, ambient temperatures, feed water and water production. The performances of the two prototypes were comparable to the results of previously published work on MSS prototypes that utilize wicking. The recovery rates of the two prototypes were 22 and 25%, respectively. The maximum production of potable water achieved from the two prototypes was 900 and 1160 g, respectively, using a feed of 4 and 3.7 kgs. The quality of the produced water met the WHO’s standards for drinking water. © 2022 by the authors.","desalination; latent heat; micro solar still; solar energy","Desalination; Developing countries; Distillation; Evaporation; Irrigation; Latent heat; Passive solar; Population statistics; Rural areas; Saline water; Satellites; Solar heating; Sustainable development; Water quality; Availability management; Feed water; Global issues; Micro solar still; Performance; Pilot studies; Solar stills; Sustainable management; United Nations; Water scarcity; Potable water","","","","","Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences, KFAS, (EA077C, PP18-15EM-09); Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research, KISR","This research was funded by the Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences (KFAS) under grant no.

However, some isolated areas in the Amazon and Galapagos Islands are not connected to the National Interconnected System. Therefore, isolated generation systems based on renewable energy sources (RES) emerge as a solution to increase electricity coverage in these areas. An extraordinary case occurs in the Galapagos Islands due to their biodiversity in flora and fauna, where the primary energy source comes from fossil fuels despite their significant amount of solar resources. Therefore, RES use, especially photovoltaic (PV) and wind power, is essential to cover the required load demand without negatively affecting the islands’ biodiversity. In this regard, the design and installation planning of PV systems require perfect knowledge of the amount of energy available at a given location, where power forecasting plays a fundamental role. Therefore, this paper presents the design and comparison of different deep learning techniques: long-short-term memory (LSTM), LSTM Projected, Bidirectional LSTM, Gated Recurrent Units, Convolutional Neural Networks, and hybrid models to forecast photovoltaic power generation in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador. The proposed approach uses an optimized hyperparameter-based Bayesian optimization algorithm to reduce the forecast error and training time. The results demonstrate the accurate performance of all the methods by achieving a low-error short-term prediction, an excellent correlation of over 99%, and minimizing the training time. © 2023 by the authors.","Bayesian optimization; convolutional neural network; long-short-term memory; photovoltaic power forecasting","Amazon Shelf; Atlantic Ocean; Ecuador; Galapagos Islands; algorithm; alternative energy; artificial neural network; Bayesian analysis; biodiversity; forecasting method; optimization; parameter estimation; photovoltaic system","","","","","DGD, (EC2020SIN322A101); KU Leuven; Belgisch Ontwikkelingsagentschap, BTC; Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, ESPE; VLIRUOS","This work is part of the projects 2023-PIS-004, 2022-PIJ-10, and 2020-EXT-007 “MIRA-ESTE: Specific, innovative microgrids solutions (accounting for environmental, social, technological and economic aspects) for isolated rural areas of Ecuador” from the Research Group of Propagation, Electronic Control, and Networking (PROCONET) of Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE and KU Leuven.

Using solar energy for the freshwater production is a big challenge due to their low productivity with relatively high cost. However, in some specific situations like rural and isolated areas, it is considered suitable. The present study aims to analyze the latest situation of the solar water desalination based on the two typical solar stills (basin and tubular). The potential of both types for leading the future development of the solar desalination has been evaluated. Various techniques and developments of solar stills such as multi-effect, wick, heat storage materials, condenser surface and photovoltaic thermal (PVT) systems and atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) have been reviewed. The most promising solar still techniques and the future expectations have been discussed at the end of the study. © 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers","AWH; Multi-effect; Nanoparticles; Parabolic concentrator; PCM; Solar desalination; TSS","Desalination; Distillation; Distillation equipment; Distilleries; Heat storage; Photovoltaic effects; Solar heating; Water conservation; Water filtration; Atmospheric water; High costs; Multi-effect; Photovoltaic thermals; Solar desalination; Solar distillation system; Solar stills; Solar waters; Solar energy","","","","","","","Abdullah A.S., Alarjani A., Abou Al-sood M.M., Omara Z.M., Kabeel A.E., Essa F.A., Rotating-wick solar still with mended evaporation technics: experimental approach, Alexandria Eng.

The concept of the proposed system was to activate the tubular solar still by a parabolic solar concentrator. This concept would increase TSS ability to evaporate water from strong desiccant of calcium chloride under extreme low humid conditions. The TSS was opened and exposed to atmospheric air during night hours starting the absorption process. At the beginning of the sunrise, the TSS was closed and placed at the focal line of the parabolic concentrator starting the regeneration process. The proposed system was able to produce 0.51 L/kg of calcium chloride. The system thermal efficiency and water production cost were 24.61% and $0.15 respectively. The proposed device increased the productivity and the efficiency of the TSS by 292.4% and 82.3%, while reduced the water production cost by 25%. The proposed system was compact, small and portable that could be operated easily in a desert, remote and isolated areas without any need for water resource or infrastructure. The proposed new system could be lifesaving in urgent situations especially in the desert areas. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air water harvesting; Calcium chloride; Desiccant; Low humid air; Parabolic concentrator; Tubular solar still","Air; Calcium chloride; Costs; Distillation; Driers (materials); Efficiency; Harvesting; Precipitation (meteorology); Runoff; Solar concentrators; Solar heating; Water conservation; Air-water; Desiccant; Humid air; Parabolic concentrators; Solar stills; Concentration (process)","","","","","University of Hail, UOH, (RG- 0191324); Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University","This study is funded by the Deanship of Scientific Research, University of Hail, Saudi Arabia ( RG- 0191324 ).

Box 04478, Brasília, 70904-970, Brazil","Sewage treatment and water reuse are, undoubtedly, one of the main points on scientific agenda of the 21st century. Many technologies for sewage treatment are available; however, it is still as an open issue that deserves much attention in order to facilitate their application, develop more effective methods and propose alternative treatment for unusual situations. Developing high performance materials for sewage treatment fits the idea of the development of efficient and alternative methods for microorganism removal and the high organic load of wastewater and is of fundamental importance. In this paper, a heterojunction with perovskite-type strontium stannate (SrSnO3) and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) — SrSnO3/g-C3N4 — was synthesized and used for photocatalytic treatment of domestic sewage using only sunlight. Results were accompanied by assessing the total organic carbon decrease and removal of pathogenic microorganisms. X-ray diffraction and X-ray excited photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated that a heterostructure was successfully formed and photocatalytic tests showed an important activity in the visible range, i.e., under sunlight. Exposing raw sewage to 240 min (from 11 a.m. until 3 p.m.) in the presence of SrSnO3/g-C3N4, led to a 56.1% mineralization. This process was 2.5 more efficient than photolysis under sunlight. Moreover, the treated sewage showed no coliform growth (either fecal or total) or heterotrophic bacteria. This simple treatment makes sewage suitable and safe for reuse, for example, for agriculture purposes according to Brazilian regulations criteria and could be an alternative for isolated areas in which sewage treatment plants are not available. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Disinfection; Domestic sewage treatment; Environmental chemistry; Photocatalytic; SrSnO<sub>3</sub>/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>","Catalysis; Disinfection; Light; Sewage; Sunlight; disinfection; inorganic compound; pollutant removal; sewage treatment; solar radiation; total organic carbon; wastewater; wastewater treatment; catalysis; disinfection; light; sewage; sunlight","","Sewage, ","","","TESL; Johns Hopkins University, JHU; University of Cambridge; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Fundação de Apoio à Pesquisa do Distrito Federal, FAPDF","Funding text 1: The authors wish to thank the CNPq, CAPES, FAPDF (Brazilian funding agencies) for their financial support.

Over the years, the fossil-fueled power stations used to generate electricity had a detrimental effects and it has necessitated the need for alternative energy sources such as solar, wind, biomass and other renewable energy sources. Hybrid energy system (HES) based on distributed energy resources (DERs) integration into the DC microgrid is considered as the viable means to carry out the electrification of rural as well as isolated area. However, DC microgrids are limited by the occurrence of faults and this affect their performance. This paper presents the modelling and simulation of power flow and the fault analysis in a hybrid DC microgrid. This hybrid DC microgrid is powered by PV and wind energy system, the formulation, modeling and simulations was implemented in the MATLAB/SIMULINK. The faults analyzed in the system are the DC line-to-ground faults and DC line-to-line faults. Results for a hybrid DC microgrid revealed that high quality of power is experienced in load distribution. Also based on the results, when DC faults occurs there is disturbance to output. © 2021 IEEE.","DC microgrids; Fault analysis; Photovoltaics; Power flow; Wind energy","MATLAB; Microgrids; Rural areas; Wind power; DC line; DC microgrid; Fault analysis; Isolated regions; Microgrid; Model and simulation; Photovoltaics; Power fault analysis; Power flow analyze; Power flows; Electric load flow","","","","","","","Eid B.M., Rahim N.A., Selvaraj J., El-Khateb A.H., Control methods and objectives for electronically coupled distributed energy resources in microgrids: A review, IEEE Systems Journal, 10, 2, pp. 446-458, (2014); Hossain E., Kabalci E., Bayindir R., Perez R., Microgrid testbeds around the world: State of art, Energy Conversion and Management, 86, pp. 132-153, (2014); Salimath G., Singh N.K., Badge S.S., Coordination and performance analysis of pumped hydro storage system integrated with solar, wind hybrid system, 2017 International Conference on Energy, Communication, Data Analytics and Soft Computing (ICECDS), pp. 160-164, (2017); Tagare D.M., Electricity Power Generation: The Changing Dimensions, (2011); Kumar P., Palwalia D.K., Decentralized autonomous hybrid renewable power generation, Journal of Renewable Energy, 2015, (2015); Zhao J., Graves K., Wang C., Liao G., Yeh C.-P., A hybrid electric/hydro storage solution for standalone photovoltaic applications in remote areas, 2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting, pp. 1-6, (2012); Council G.W.E., Global Wind Report Annual Market Update 2012, (2011); Grogg K., Harvesting the wind: The physics of wind turbines, Physics and Astronomy Comps Papers, 7, (2005); Khaimar A.K., Shah P., Study of various types of faults in HVDC transmission system, 2016 International Conference on Global Trends in Signal Processing, Information Computing and Communication (ICGTSPICC), pp. 480-484, (2016); Leterme W., Van Hertem D., Classification of fault clearing strategies for HVDC grids, Cigre, (2015); Rahman M.M., Rabbi M.F., Islam M.K., Rahman F.M., HVDC over HVAC power transmission system: Fault current analysis and effect comparison, 2014 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Information &Communication Technology, pp. 1-6, (2014); Dufo-Lopez R., Bernal-Agustin J.L., Multi-objective design of PV-wind-diesel-hydrogen-battery systems, Renewable Energy, 33, 12, pp. 2559-2572, (2008); Bilal B.O., Sambou V., Ndiaye P., Kebe C., Ndongo M., Optimal design of a hybrid solar-wind-battery system using the minimization of the annualized cost system and the minimization of the loss of power supply probability (LPSP), Renewable Energy, 35, 10, pp. 2388-2390, (2010); Pachori A., Suhane P., Modeling and simulation of photovoltaic/wind/diesel/battery hybrid power generation system, International Journal of Electrical, Electronics and Computer Engineering, 3, 1, (2014); Lee T.-Y., Chen C.-L., Wind-photovoltaic capacity coordination for a time-of-use rate industrial user, Iet Renewable Power Generation, 3, 2, pp. 152-167, (2009); Sheraz M., Abido M., An efficient fuzzy logic based maximum power point tracking controller for photovoltaic systems, International Conference on Renewable Energies and Power Quality, pp. 4-10, (2013); Oi A., Design and Simulation of Photovoltaic Water Pumping System, (2005)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","8th Annual IEEE Power and Energy Society and Industrial Applications Society PowerAfrica Conference, PowerAfrica 2021","23 August 2021 through 27 August 2021","Virtual, Nairobi","172032","","978-166540311-5","","","English","IEEE PES/IAS PowerAfrica, PowerAfrica","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116665181"

This experimental study was carried using a prototype of a rural house, located at the Technological University of Peru-Arequipa, Peru. The photovoltaic solar system, connected to the prototype house, supplied its electric loads (TV, Blu-ray, radio, refrigerator, blender, heater, washing machine, fan, iron), which were programmed to be turned on and off using digital timers during a period of 3 months (March, April and May 2020). The measured parameters were the solar power, the consumed electrical power and the electrical power of what would be an auxiliary source of energy (electric generator, for example) in case the solar resource is unavailable. The results indicate that the photovoltaic solar system could store the unused solar energy to supply the nighttime electrical loads, ensuring, in this way, the autonomy of the energy system. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

The proposed system is designed for remote, isolated areas with limited electricity and freshwater access. For commercial PVDF membranes, the performance of the MD unit is evaluated at various feed temperatures, flow rates, and salt concentrations. In addition, the effect of MD cell design was examined to determine the effect of the obstacles on the feed channel. Increasing the temperature by 20 degrees from 55 to 75 °C enhances productivity by 165 % from 6.2 to 16.4 kg/m2.h. At different operating conditions, the new design of the MD cell with cylindrical obstacles attained higher flux productivity compared to the conventional MD cell design. The maximum attained freshwater output flux was around 15 kg/m2.h at a feed inlet temperature of 65 °C and feed mass flowrate of 66 kg/h for the MD cell with cylindrical obstacles. In the presence of obstacles, a reduction in the specific energy consumption (SEC) by 35–15 % is associated with an increase in the gain output ratio (GOR) by 50–20 % compared to the case of no obstacles. Observations indicate that a small PV module with an area of 0.377 m2 is sufficient to operate the membrane unit for contentious 15 h. Collectively, using solar MD units collectively has the potential to be used for decentralized desalination of water. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Membrane distillation; Salt rejection; Solar energy; Solar water desalination","Cells; Cytology; Desalination; Distillation; Energy utilization; Solar panels; Water; Water filtration; Cell design; Desalination systems; Desalination units; Fresh Water; Membrane distillation; PVDF membrane; Salt rejections; Solar water desalination; Solar waters; Water desalination; desalination; distillation; experimental study; salt; solar power; Solar energy","","","","","Academy of Scientific Research and Technology, ASRT, (2022)","The authors acknowledge the Academy of Scientific Research and Technology - Graduation Project Program (2022) in Egypt for funding and supporting the project.","Ranjan K.R., Kaushik S.C., Energy, exergy and thermo-economic analysis of solar distillation systems: a review, Renew.

To mitigate the detrimental impacts of the conventional energy resources, this paper provides an idea about an off-grid, distributed solar-piezo power generating technique usable for residential & isolated area applications. The primary power is supplied by the solar panel, and the subordinate power can be added by the produced energy from the piezoelectric modules, and the battery model is employed for continuous power supply in the suggested hybrid renewable power system.Furthermore, the dc-dc boost converter for PV and piezoelectric modules is designed to connect two power inputs in parallel. The present study focuses upon the design of the proposed system & scopes of the proposed system in Tripura, a hilly state in the North-Eastern Province of India.Tripura has ranked 56th amongst 100 smart cities in the countryaccording to Smart City rankings released in July 2020 & also 1st among all the North-Eastern states. Thus, the motto of the paper is to draw attention towards implementation of green energy harvesting techniques in Tripura which will certainly help to mitigate the techno-economic barriers in the region &successfully mitigating the energy requirements. The modelling and simulation of the proposed hybrid arrangement has been carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK. The analysis of the proposed system portrays the effectiveness of the proposed system.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Battery; MATLAB; North-east; Piezoelectric; PV","Boost converter; Energy harvesting; Environmental technology; Piezoelectricity; Secondary batteries; Smart city; Solar panels; Battery; Design Analysis; Energy consumer; Energy Harvester; Environmental issues; North-east; Off-grids; Piezoelectric; Power; PV; MATLAB","","","","","","","Mehrpooya M, Mohammadi M, Ahmadia E, Techno-economic-environmental study of hybrid power supply system: A case study in Iran, Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments, 25, 1, (2016); Al-Sharafi A, Yilbas B S., Sahin A Z., Ayar T, Performance assessment of hybrid power generation systems: Economic and environmental impacts, Energy Conversion and Management, 132, pp. 418-431, (2017); Hatti M, Meharrar A, Tioursi M, Power management strategy in the alternative energy photovoltaic/PEM Fuel Cell hybrid system, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 15, pp. 5104-5110, (2011); Bazmia A A., Zahedi G, Sustainable energy systems: Role of optimization modeling techniques in power generation and supply-A review, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 15, pp. 3480-3500, (2011); Nayyar Z A., Zaigham N A., Qadeer A, Assessment of present conventional and non-conventional energy scenario of Pakistan, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 31, pp. 543-553, (2014); Shang C, Srinivasan D, Reindl T, An improved particle swarm optimisation algorithm applied to battery sizing for stand-alone hybrid power systems, Electrical Power and Energy Systems, 74, pp. 104-117, (2016); Hosseinalizadeh R, Shakouri G H., Amalnick M S., Taghipour P, Economic sizing of a hybrid (PV-WT-FC) renewable energy system (HRES) for stand-alone usages by an optimization-simulation model: Case study of Iran, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 54, pp. 139-150, (2016); Liu W H., Alwi S R.

Russia has a huge territory that is not connected to power grids, many villages aren't connected to natural gas network and don't have district heating systems. Approach consists of several steps. On the first step we choose isolated areas and villages that have no chances to get connection to natural gas grid. Even if they are connected to power grids, they still have a room for autonomic solutions in producing heat/hot water. In many cases quality of power is not very good. Then on the second step we compare different combinations of traditional (LNG/CNG/LPG/diesel) and renewable (PV panels, solar collectors, wind turbines + heat/power storage units) power sources in order to find the best way of power/heat supply for the village. In the article the approach is shown on two different examples - Dagestan (south of Russia) and Yakutia (north of Russia).

However, this area has a great solar potential. In this work, we propose a sizing model for a Solar Pumping System according to the available energy and the identified uses. This sizing is based on the cost criterion that we wish to minimize under a few constraints. The objective of this study is to optimise the pumping system to ensure the availability of energy as close as possible to the needs so that the isolated areas benefit from it in line with their resources. We illustrate the validation of the proposed method by three scenarios. As a result, the usage profile has a major impact on the optimal design of a Solar Pumping System and therefore on the final cost of the installation. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Energy management; Energy storage; Optimal design; Renewable energy; Solar pumping; System sizing","Energy management systems; Energy storage; Optimal systems; Pumped storage power plants; Pumping plants; Pumps; Available energy; Clean waters; Cost criteria; Energy; Optimal design; Renewable energies; Solar potential; Solar pumping; Solar pumping systems; System sizings; Energy management","","","","","","","Oyerinde A.O., Jacobs H.E., The complex nature of household water supply: An evidence-based assessment of urban water access in Southwest Nigeria, J.

Most of these are out of national grid coverage. Therefore, renewable energy technology (RET) is the only solution for electrification. However, proper investigation and research are needed to select the most suitable renewable energy technology. In this study, focus is given on the southern region of the country to select the best RET. Based on the currently available technology and potentiality of the renewable energy resources in the country, five types of RETs are selected for evaluation. These are solar, wind, biomass to electricity, biogas to electricity and solar-wind-battery hybrid energy system. To evaluate the best RET, Multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDM) method is used where an integrated Entropy-EDAS (Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution) model is proposed to identify the best RET in the study area. At first, the key criteria and sub-criteria were selected to analyse five (5) types of RETs. These criteria were categorised as economic, technical, environmental, and socio-political. Additionally, 12 sub-criteria were selected under the umbrella of four main criteria. Then, Shannon's Entropy method was deployed to find the weights of the criteria and sub-criteria. Finally, a new MCDM method, named EDAS, was applied to select the best RET in the study area. The results revealed that the Solar-Wind-Battery hybrid energy system is the best option. The outcome of this study and the decision model might be applicable to other isolated areas in the country, particularly in the southern region of Bangladesh. © 2019 International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.","EDAS; Entropy; MCDM; Renewable energy technology","Decision theory; Electric batteries; Renewable energy resources; Solar wind; Bangladesh; EDAS; Hybrid energy system; Multi criteria decision-making; Multicriteria decision making methods; Multicriteria decision-making; Multicriterion decision makings; Renewable energy technologies; Solar/wind; Study areas; Decision making","","","","","","","Pavan M., Todeschini R., Multicriteria Decision Making Methods, (2009); Alam M., Bhattacharyya S., Decentralized renewable hybrid mini-grids for sustainable electrification of the off-grid coastal areas of Bangladesh, Energies, (2016); Blechinger P., Seguin R., Cader C., Bertheau P., Breyer C., Assessment of the global potential for renewable energy storage systems on small islands, Energy Procedia, (2014); Rashid S., Rana S., Shezan S., Optimized design of a hybrid PV-wind-diesel energy system for sustainable development at coastal areas in Bangladesh, Environ.

Its economical price means that the installation of systems based on non-conventional renewable energy sources does not represent a benefit for the user. However, rural communities isolated from the NIS do not have electricity services. Due to this, isolated systems become an effective option to supply electricity to these communities. In this regard, the Galapagos Islands have unique biodiversity in the world. Since they are not connected to the NIS, their primary energy sources are based on biogas obtained from fossil fuels, with their negative consequences despite the great potential of solar resources. Hence the need to use non-conventional renewable energy sources that covers the energy demand and do not affect the biodiversity there. Photovoltaic energy forecasting is an essential step in the installation of photovoltaic systems. Prediction models based on deep learning (DL) techniques can obtain a high degree of accuracy in energy prediction tasks. For this reason, this work presents the development of long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) models to predict photovoltaic energy in an isolated area of Ecuador. The results highlight the performance of both methods through the achieved short-term prediction.  © 2022 IEEE.","gate recurrent unit; long-short term memory; photovoltaic power; power forecasting; recurrent neural network","Biodiversity; Brain; Forecasting; Fossil fuels; Learning systems; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Ecuador; Electricity-generation; Gate recurrent unit; Learning techniques; Photovoltaic energy; Photovoltaic power; Power forecasting; Renewable energy source; Rural community; Short-term forecasting; Long short-term memory","","","","","DGD, (EC2020SIN322A101); Belgisch Ontwikkelingsagentschap, BTC; VLIRUOS","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work is part of the projects 2022-PIJ-10 and 2020-EXT-007 “MIRA-ESTE: Specific, innovative microgrids solutions (accounting for environmental, social, technological and economic aspects) for isolated rural areas of Ecuador” from the Research Group of Propagation, Electronic Control, and Networking (PROCONET) of Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE and KU Leuven.

However, the risks related to the presence of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) or pathogenic microorganisms in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent suggest the need to implement effective and relatively low-cost tertiary treatments. With this aim, a self-sustainable pilot prototype based on three combined modules (disc-filtration, granular activated carbon (GAC) bed adsorption and UV disinfection) assisted by solar panels was installed as an alternative tertiary treatment in a conventional WWTP in the Murcia region. The obtained results clearly confirmed the efficiency of the proposed prototype for CECs removal, and showed optimal results at a workflow of 500 L/h. In all cases, high removal efficiency was obtained for the different indicator microorganisms described in the recently published Regulation (EU) 2020/741 (E. coli, F-specific coliphages, somatic coliphages, total coliphages, and Clostridium perfringens). The protection of the activated carbon by disc-filters and the energy autonomy and self-operation of the prototype resulted in an efficient and economically viable methodology for its implementation in both conventional WWTPs and in isolated areas attached to crops. © 2020 by the authors.","Adsorption; Autonomous prototype; Emerging contaminants; Filtration; Granular activated carbon; Reclaimed water; Safe agricultural reuse","Murcia [Spain]; Spain; Clostridium perfringens; Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Effluent treatment; Microorganisms; Sewage treatment plants; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Water quality; Clostridium perfringens; Contaminants of emerging concerns; Economically viable; Global water resources; Granular activated carbons; Pathogenic microorganisms; Removal efficiencies; Wastewater treatment plants; activated carbon; autonomy; bacteriophage; bacterium; disinfection; effluent; European Union; pollutant removal; sustainability; wastewater treatment plant; water quality; Effluents","","","","","AZUD; Centro De Edafología y Biología Aplicada Del Segura; Centro Tecnológico de la Energía y Medio Ambiente; Consejería de Empleo, Universidades, Empresa y Medio Ambiente; ESAMUR; Empresa Municipal de Aguas y Saneamiento de Murcia; Entidad de Saneamiento y Depuración de Aguas Residuales de la Región de Murcia; Universidad de Murcia; Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena, UPCT; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF; Instituto Madrileño de Investigación y Desarrollo Rural, Agrario y Alimentario, IMIDRA","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the strategic project Ris3mur REUSAGUA, funded by Consejería de Empleo, Universidades, Empresa y Medio Ambiente (Government of Murcia) under the European Regional Development Fund ERDF 2014-2020, which started in September 2016 and will run until the end of December 2020.

Among various renewable energy sources, solar power is usable everywhere as long as there is solar radiation. It is particularly useful for isolated areas where there is no access to any other source of electricity. However, the inherent uncertainty of solar radiation and climate changes may result in a high initial investment cost that could make this type of energy system economically infeasible. To obtain a PV-battery system at a reasonable investment cost, a home-backup diesel generator is assumed to be available. We develop a scenario-based optimization model to determine the capacity of residential off-grid PV-battery systems that consider solar radiation uncertainty and hourly energy consumption patterns. The optimization model determines the PV-battery capacities to supply the energy demanded at each period by minimizing the annual equivalent investment cost and the fuel cost of using the diesel generator. The impact of scenarios on the model results is evaluated by changing the number of scenarios. © 2022","Energy consumption scheduling; Mixed-integer programming; PV-battery capacity; Solar irradiance uncertainty; Stochastic optimization","Climate change; Costs; Diesel engines; Electric batteries; Housing; Integer programming; Investments; Natural resources; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Battery capacity; Energy consumption scheduling; Energy-consumption; Mixed-Integer Programming; Optimization models; PV-battery capacity; Solar irradiance uncertainty; Solar irradiances; Stochastic optimizations; Uncertainty; alternative energy; detection method; electricity generation; model; optimization; photovoltaic system; solar power; solar radiation; Energy utilization","","","","","","","Ahmad G.E., Photovoltaic-powered rural zone family house in Egypt, Renewable Energy, 26, pp. 379-390, (2002); Arun P., Banerjee R., Bandyopadhyay S., Optimum sizing of photovoltaic battery systems incorporating uncertainty through design space approach, Sol.

These constitute a substantial source of pollution in addition to being quickly depleted. Isolated areas and communities cannot profit from this type of electric energy for the reason that they are far from the grid. The hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) have demonstrated to be an excellent solution for such a situation. The purpose of this paper is to design and optimize a standalone hybrid energy system to satisfy the electricity demand for a remote drilling site in Adrar province located in the South of Algeria. To cure the problem of intermittence of the solar and wind sources, a hydrogen-based set up is appended to the hybrid renewable energy system. The simulations are done using HOMER software to determine the optimal the HRES configurations considering techno-economic criteria.  © 2022 IEEE.","HOMER; Hydrogen System; Renewable Energies; Sizing; Techno-economic Study","Fossil fuels; Silicon; Solar power generation; Conventional power; Energy systems; HOMER; Hybrid renewable energies; Hydrogen system; Renewable energies; Sizing; Sizing optimization; System sizings; Techno-economic studies; Renewable energy resources","","","","","","","Global Status Report Paris, Renewables, 2017, (2017); IEA Renewables Information-Key Renewables Trends, (2016); Chellali F., Et al., A Contribution to the actualization of the wind map of Algeria, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 15, 2, pp. 993-1002, (2011); Ferrer-Martia L., Garwood A., Chiroque J., Ramirez B., Marcelo O., Garfi M., Velo E., Evaluating and comparing three community small-scale wind electrification projects, Renewable Sustain.

This type of power plant is called a floating power plant or barge-mounted power plant or barge. Floating power plants can use a various of energy sources, such as steam energy, gas energy, nuclear energy, solar energy, ocean current energy, and sea wave energy. According to the plan for a nuclear power plant ship to be built on the island of Bangka, it is necessary to consider the aspects of evaluating the safety of the nuclear power plant site. This paper discusses the elements of site safety evaluation for nuclear power plants using descriptive methods and qualitatively with literature studies. The site evaluation of the floating power plants must be carried out in accordance with the existing laws and regulations, even though the regulations in Indonesia are addressed to land-based power reactors and the evaluations related to buildings and installations in the sea for electricity installations may refer to the existing regulations, which is Government Regulation Number 27 of 2021 concerning the Implementation of the Marine and Fisheries Sector, which regulates power generating ships. This study concludes that the regulation for site safety evaluation that applies to land-based nuclear reactors is still applicable for floating nuclear power plants. © 2023 Author(s).","","","","","","","","","Devara B.T., Design of Power Generation Ships Using Ocean Wave Power for the Papua Region, (2017); Regulation of Nuclear Energy Regulatory Agency Number 4 of 2018 on Provisions for Safety Evaluation of Nuclear Installation Sites, (2018); Government Regulation of the Republic of Indonesia Number 54 of 2012 on Safety and Security of Nuclear Installations, (2012); Government Regulation of the Republic of Indonesia Number 2 of 2014 on Licensing of Nuclear Installations and Utilization of Nuclear Materials, (2014); Babu P.V.T., Reddy D.V., Existing Methodologies in the Design and Analysis of Offshore Floating Nuclear Power Plants, Nuclear Engineering and Design, 48, 1, pp. 167-205; Government Regulation of the Republic of Indonesia Number 27 of 2021, Implementation of the Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Sector, (2021); Regulation of the Chairmen of the Nuclear Energy Regulatory Agency Number 8 of 2013, on Evaluation of the Nuclear Installation Site for Seismic Aspects, Jakarta, (2013); Regulation of the Chairmen of the Nuclear Energy Regulatory Agency Number, 5 of 2015 on Evaluation of Nuclear Installation Sites for Volcanic Aspects, (2015); Regulation of the Chairmen of the Nuclear Energy Regulatory Agency Number 4 of 2008 on Evaluation of Power Reactor Sites for Geotechnical Aspects and Power Reactor Foundations, (2008); Regulation of the Chairmen of the Nuclear Energy Regulatory Agency Number 6 of 2014 on Evaluation of Nuclear Installation Sites for Meteorological and Hydrological Aspects, (2014); Evaluation of Nuclear Installation Sitesfor Aspects of External Events Due to Man-made Activities, (2019); Pandi L.Y., Aji B., Pramono J., Assessment Report on Safety, Security and Safeguards of Floating Nuclear Power Plant, (2021); A Survey of Unique Technical Features of the Floating Nuclear Power Plant Concept, (1974); Regulation of the Chairmen of the Nuclear Energy Regulatory Agency Number 4 of 2019 on Evaluation of Nuclear Installation Sitesfor Dispersion Aspects of Radioactive Substances in Air and Water, (2019)","L.Y.

However, the majority of study has been focused on the techno-economic aspects of producing electricity in support of this isolated area. To bridge the gap, the present study proposes a methodology for assessing off-grid hybrid microgrid pertaining to the priorities of four key sustainability performance indicators (KSPI): economy, environment, technology, and society. The evaluation process also includes total 13 sets of sub-indicators under KSPI, such as levelized cost of energy, return on investment, CO2 emissions, renewable fraction, excess electricity, unmet load, land usage, job creation etc. The comprehensive value of KSPI regarding economic, environmental, technical, and social priorities are computed using fuzzy logic Mamdani type rules, which facilitates human judgment in linguistic terms and eliminates weightage ambiguity. Seven microgrid scenarios integrating locally accessible resources have been scored and ranked to identify suitable configuration. According to the findings, the PV/Wind/Diesel/Converter/Battery combination reveals best option considering economic priority. On the other hand, the PV/Wind/Converter/Battery alternative receives excellent performance scores and is recommended in both environmental and social categories. However, the PV/Diesel/Converter/Battery arrangement outperforms the others architectures and gets preference for technical reasons. Additionally, the electrical, financial, emission, and sensitivity analysis are carried out for a selected microgrid in Kutubdia. This assessment framework can assist academics, policymakers and investors for planning microgrid in a better way based on sustainable dimensions.  © 2013 IEEE.","Cost of energy; fuzzy logic; Kutubdia; microgrid; multi-criterion decision analysis; net present cost; renewable energy; solar PV; sustainability; wind turbine","Benchmarking; Computer circuits; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Decision making; Economic analysis; Electric power systems; Investments; Landforms; Linguistics; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable development; Wind turbines; Cost of energies; Fuzzy-Logic; Generator; Kutubdia; Microgrid; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Net present cost; Renewable energies; Solar PVs; Fuzzy logic","","","","","","","Nandi S.K., Ghosh H.R., Techno-economical analysis of off-grid hybrid systems at Kutubdia Island, Bangladesh, Energy Policy, 38, 2, pp. 976-980, (2010); Offroad Bangladesh; Upazila K., National Cyclopedia of Bangladesh; Sarker M.T., Rahman M.A., Mahmud Z.H., Electricity demand load forecasting for a remote area of Bangladesh, Int.

A translocation programme released birds from a breeding centre into the nearby (<3 km) pine forests of La Cumbre in the years following 2010. From 2015 to 2019 the La Cumbre population was reinforced by translocation of wild juveniles from the source population of Inagua. We estimate the population size, the spatial variation of abundance, and recent temporal changes in density of the species in Inagua and La Cumbre by means of line transects, distance sampling, and habitat suitability modelling using random forests. The average density of the Blue Chaffinch in Inagua Nature Reserve was 10.2 birds/km2 in spring 2019, with a population estimated at 362 birds (95% CI: 257-489). The most important variables affecting the distribution of the Blue Chaffinch in Inagua were the amount of precipitation during the summer (July-September), the solar radiation in June, and the northern position in the reserve, highlighting the importance of abiotic factors related to thermal and hydric stress during the breeding season. The density was considerably lower in the translocated population inhabiting 21 km2 of pine forests in La Cumbre (3.3 birds/km2), with an estimate of 68 Blue Chaffinches (35-141) breeding freely in the wild. The translocation programme successfully contributed to the establishment of a second viable nucleus, accounting for 16% of the total population within a time span of 10 years. This result reinforces the role of translocations in preventing extinctions of endangered species with very low population sizes restricted to only one isolated area.  ©","","Canary Islands; Spain; abiotic factor; abundance; breeding season; endangered species; habitat structure; passerine; population size; spatial variation; temporal variation","","","","","Gobierno de Canarias; European Commission, EC, (LIFE14 NAT/ES/000077); Cabildo de Gran Canaria","This study was supported by several conservation programmes funded by the Gobierno de Canarias (1991–2004), Cabildo de Gran Canaria (2005–2015), and the European Union (2015-2019: LIFE14 NAT/ES/000077).

Pollution mainly arises from the burning of fossil fuel which emits CO2 and other harmful gases in the environment. The transportation sector is introducing technologically advanced Electric Vehicles (EVs) which are eco-friendly. EV integration to the grid is the attraction of many researchers and engineers around the world due to the rapidly growing numbers of EVs in the global market. The use of EVs in the grid will play an important role in future smart grid technology. But EVs charging puts significant load demand on the grid as well as uneven and uncoordinated charging creates disturbance in the grid. In order to reduce the burden on the grid, the EVs can be charged by Renewable Energy Resources (RESs). Solar is the most widely available renewable energy source. Solar charging stations can be installed at homes, offices, parking lots, public areas and isolated areas. The proposed system in this chapter is designed in the MATLAB Simulink environment in which Electric Vehicle (EV) is charged in a standalone solar power charging station and this EV is integrated into the grid when the solar power is unavailable. The use of a DC–DC bidirectional converter with appropriate controlling technique enables the transfer of power from EV to the grid whenever there is demand. The benefits and limitations of integrating EV in the power systems have been discussed in this chapter. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","DC–AC converter; DC–DC bidirectional converter; Electric Vehicle (EV); Solar-to-Vehicle (S2V); Vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","","","","","","","","Deb S., Tammi K., Kalita K., Mahanta P., Charging station placement for electric vehicles: A case study of Guwahati City, India, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 100270-100282, (2019); Fathabadi H., Novel solar powered electric vehicle charging station with the capability of vehicle-to-grid, Solar Energy, 142, pp. 136-143, (2017); Ghazanfari A., Hamzeh M., Mohamed Y.A.I., A resilient plug-and-play decentralized control for DC parking lots, IEEE Trans Smart Grid, 9, 3, pp. 1930-1942, (2018); Huang P., Zhang X., Copertaro B., Saini P.K., Yan D., Wu Y., Chen X., A Technical review of modeling techniques for urban solar mobility: Solar to buildings, vehicles, and storage (S2BVS), Sustainability, 12, (2020); Liu S., Xie X., Yang L., Analysis, modeling and implementation ofa switching bi-directional buck-boost converter based on electric vehicle hybrid energy storage for V2G system, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 65868-65879, (2020); de Melo H.N., Trovao J.P.F., Pereirinha P.G., Jorge H.M., Antunes C.H., A controllable bidirectional battery charger for electric vehicles with vehicle-to-grid capability, IEEE Trans Veh Technol, 67, 1, pp. 114-123, (2018); Mishra S., Dwivedi G., Upadhyay S., Chauhan A., Modelling of standalone solar photovoltaic based electric bike charging, Materials Today: Proceedings, (2021); Mohammed S.A.Q., Jung J.-W., A comprehensive state-of-the-art review of wired/wireless charging technologies for battery electric vehicles: Classification/common topologies/future research issues, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 19572-19585, (2021); Nguyen H.V., To D., Lee D., Onboard battery chargers for plug-in electric vehicles with dual functional circuit for low-voltage battery charging and active power decoupling, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 70212-70222, (2018); Patil H., Kalkhambkar V.N., Grid integration of electric vehicles for economic benefits: A review, J Modern Power Syst Clean Energy, 9, 1, pp. 13-26, (2021); Preetha Yesheswini B., Jai Iswarya S., Amani B., Prakash P., Sindhu M.R., Solar PV charging station for electric vehicles, pp. 1-7, (2020); Prem P., Sivaraman P., Sakthi Suriya Raj J.S., Jagabar Sathik M., Almakhles D., Fast charging converter and control algorithm for solar PV battery and electrical grid integrated electric vehicle charging station, Automatika, 61, 4, pp. 614-625, (2020); Qin D., Sun Q., Wang R., Ma D., Liu M., Adaptive bidirectional droop control for electric vehicles parking with vehicle-to-grid service in microgrid, CSEE J Power Energy Syst, 6, 4, pp. 793-805, (2020); Shariff S.M., Alam M.S., Ahmad F., Rafat Y., Asghar M.S.J., Khan S., System design and realization of a solar-powered electric vehicle charging station, IEEE Syst J, 14, 2, pp. 2748-2758, (2020); Shahrukh Adnan Khan M.D., Mahtab Kadir K., Sultan Mahmood K., Ibrahim Ibne A.M., Kamal A., Al Bashir M.M., Technical investigation on V2G, S2V, and V2I for next generation smart city planning, J Electron Sci Technol, 17, 4, (2019); Singh A.K., Mishra A.K., Gupta K.K., Bhatnagar P., Kim T., An integrated converter with reduced components for electric vehicles utilizing solar and grid power sources, IEEE Trans Transport Electrific, 6, 2, pp. 439-452, (2020); Sneha Angeline P.M., Newlin Rajkumar M., Evolution of electric vehicle and its future scope, 33, pp. 3930-3936, (2020); Taghizadeh S., Hossain M.J., Poursafar N., Lu J., Konstantinou G., A multifunctional single-phase EV on-board charger with a new V2V charging assistance capability, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 116812-116823, (2020); Tran V.T., Islam M.R., Muttaqi K.M., Sutanto D., An efficient energy management approach for a solar-powered EV battery charging facility to support distribution grids, IEEE Trans Industry Appl, 55, 6, pp. 6517-6526, (2019); Yuan J., Dorn-Gomba L., Callegaro A.D., Reimers J., Emadi A., A review of bidirectional onboard chargers for electric vehicles, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 51501-51518, (2021)","S.

A number of renewable energy schemes are being encouraged by central and state governments. Those schemes which are dependent on carbon-credits, or on continuation of presently available generous subsidies, or are secured through ""political leverage"" or ""patronage"", or rely on licensed imported technology, or without assured long-term off-take are all doubtful propositions commercially. Furthermore, small schemes do not appear to be attractive unless it can be demonstrated clearly that the LCOE (levellized cost of electricity) and the PP (payback-period) are attractive, irrespective of the conversion efficiency of heat into electricity. The lowtemperature ORC (Organic Rankine Cycle) scheme proposed herein meets all these criteria, is cost-effective and can be developed indigenously. The ORC plants are small, modular and scalable. They can be easily transported, assembled and commissioned at site rapidly, in small industrial units or incorporated into ""micro-grids"" for remote isolated areas. The heat-energy converter of the ORC plant is a hermetically sealed unit with very few moving parts. The technology is available now and proven. The plant requires no operator, the maintenance cost is negligible over long periods, and the unit can be operated and monitored remotely. The present chapter describes two ORC arrangements which were modelled for two types of heat sources in MATLAB software and Genetic Algorithm, which were used for parametric optimization to maximize the thermal efficiency for eight different working fluids. The novel objective of the study is to relate thermal efficiency and other parameters of the cycle with thermo physical properties of the working fluids for better selection. For more accurate results, isentropic efficiency of the scroll expander used was not fixed; instead a regression model was used to evaluate the efficiency with pressure ratio variation with fixed built in volume ratio. It was found that higher the critical pressure and smaller the chain length of the refrigerant, higher would be the thermal efficiency of the working fluid. For geothermal heat source, R11 had the maximum thermal efficiency of 14.9%. And for solar heat source, it was observed that Benzene had the maximum thermal efficiency of 9.6%. It was also observed that aromatic refrigerants like benzene and toluene are good for low temperature heat sources only. The average increment in thermal efficiency from basic ORC to recuperated ORC is 2.5% and 0.5% for geothermal and solar respectively which shows that recuperator is not a big advantage for low temperature heat sources. It was also found that the optimum pressure ratios for these two fluids were 8.23 and 5.03 which are very close to the peak of expander isentropic curve which signifies the importance of expander efficiency in performance analysis. © 2020 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Genetic algorithm; Matlab; Organic rankine cycle; Thermal efficiency""","","","","","","","","Global Energy and CO2 Status Report, (2018); Chen H., Yogi Goswami D., Stefanakos E.K., A review of thermodynamic cycles and working fluids for the conversion of low-grade heat, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 14, pp. 3059-3067, (2010); Liu W., Zhang X., Zhao N., Shu C., Zhang S., Ma Z., Han J., Performance analysis of organic Rankine cycle power generation system for intercooled cycle gas turbine, Advances in Mechanical Engineering, 10, 8, pp. 1-12, (2018); Badr O., Probert S.D., O'Callaghan P.W., Selecting a working fluid for a Rankine cycle Engine, Applied Energy, 21, pp. 1-42, (1985); Saleh B., Koglbauer G., Wendland M., Fischer J., Working fluids for low temperature organic Rankine cycles, Energy, 32, pp. 1210 -1221, (2007); Douvartzides S., Karmalis I., Working fluid selection for the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) exhaust heat recovery of an internal combustion engine power plant, IOP Conf, Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 161, (2016); Peng X., Jian L., Tai-lu L., Jia-ling Z., Thermodynamic optimization and fluid selection of organic Rankine cycle driven by a latent heat source, J.

Besides being easy to apply, the infrastructure is usually more flexible than other power plants and the resources can be found almost anywhere. Along with the increasingly frequent use of PV power plants in isolated areas, there are obstacles to land use, especially in island areas, where land has been used for housing and community activity areas, so that there is no location left for PV power plants placement. Therefore, the PV power plant is installed above the water surface, known as offshore floating PV. Offshore floating PV and conventional land PV have different ecosystems, so there will be differences in performance. The performance of the power system is one aspect of choosing which system is best to apply. In this research, the indicators of the performance of the power system are voltage, current, and power output. They will be compared between offshore floating PV and conventional PV on land. The research location is the Kudingarenglompo island, which is an island located off the coast of Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. 400kW is provided as system capacity, which is based on the existing power system on the island. The research results show that current and voltage on offshore floating PV are higher than conventional PV on land, so the power output from offshore floating PV is higher than on land PV. The average power output on land PV is 1,29% lower than on offshore floating PV. © 2021 IEEE.","Efficiency; Isolated Area; Offshore floating PV; Performance; Renewable Energy","Energy efficiency; Hydroelectric power plants; Land use; Landforms; Renewable energy resources; Thermoelectric power; Isolated area; Offshore floating; Offshore floating PV; Performance; Performances analysis; Power; Power output; PV Power plants; PV system; Renewable energies; Offshore oil well production","","","","","","","Umoette A.T., Ubom E.A., Festus M.U., Design of standalone offshore floating pv system for ibeno health centre, Science Journal of Energy Engineering, 4, 6, pp. 56-61, (2016); Javed A., The effect of temperatures on the silicon solar cell, Int.

However, the autonomous Photovoltaic/Battery system, like all other renewable energy systems, has the same design and operating challenges: appropriate size and energy management. In this regard, the Electric systems Cascade Extended Analysis method is offered to overcome the design challenges of the system. The method includes two algorithms: the first is used to scale the system by determining the ideal battery capacity and the number of Photovoltaic panels required to fulfill a load profile. The first algorithm also includes techno-economic optimization based on the Life Cycle Cost and the Levelized Cost of Electricity as economic parameters and the Loss of Power Supply Probability as a technical indicator. The first algorithm is based on the study site's climatic data (solar irradiation & temperature) and the economic and technical of the panel and battery selected for the study. The second algorithm is used for optimal management. Each of the electrical load and the battery is electrically connected to the management system, which makes instant comparisons between the real-time load power and the desired load power to fix the intensity of the charge/discharge current of the battery by controlling the duty cycles of the bi-directional converter linked to the battery. The simulation and the experimental assembly of the system showed the method's high efficiency in optimally designing and operating Photovoltaic/Battery systems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Battery; Energy management strategy;

This paper presents an analysis of wind-photovoltaic (PV) hybrid generation scheme to be used in isolation from the grid for managing irrigation and supplying some other critical loads. The proposed generation scheme can be used to generate power with varying wind speeds. The load voltage will be maintained using availability of power from wind or PV sources. The proposed scheme can be installed in a hilly region or in any onshore areas which is isolated from the grid. The proposed scheme is also flexible to be connected to grid if required. The control is done using a smart controller. The simulation and experimental results validate that the proposed hybrid generation can be suitably used, installed and employed for isolated power generation effectively especially for irrigation management.  © 2022 IEEE.","critical load; grid isolated area; hybrid generation; irrigation management; smart control; wind-photovoltaic (PV)","Renewable energy resources; Critical load; Grid isolated area; Hybrid generation; Irrigation management; Photovoltaics; Power; Prospectives; Smart control; Wind speed; Wind-photovoltaic; Irrigation","","","","","","","Patel M.R., Wind and solar power systems: Design, analysis and operation, (2006); Chatterjee A., Ghosh S., Chatterjee D., Analysis and control of a two winding IG based wind-photovoltaic generation scheme for domestic application, Proceedings of IEEE Calcutta Conference (CALCON), pp. 292-297, (2017); Chatterjee A., Chatterjee D., PV-assisted microgeneration scheme with single-phase in-duction generator suitable for wide speed range application, IET Power Electronics, 10, 14, pp. 1859-1869, (2017); Liu C., Chau K.T., Zhang X., An efficient wind-photovoltaic hybrid generation system using doubly excited permanent-magnet brushless machine, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 57, 3, pp. 831-839, (2010); Katsigiannis Y.A., Georgilakis P.S., Tsinarakis G.J., A novel colored fluid stochastic petri net simulation model for reliability evaluation of wind/PV/diesel small isolated power systems, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics-Part A: Systems and Humans, 40, 6, pp. 1296-1309, (2010); Silva L.M.R., Beluco A., Daronco G., A wind PV diesel hybrid system for energizing a sewage station in Santa Rosa, in southern Brazil, IEEE Latin America Transactions, 18, 4, pp. 773-780, (2020); Oladigbolu J.O., Ramli M.A.M., Al-Turki Y.A., Feasibility study and comparative analysis of hybrid renewable power system for off-grid rural electrification in a typical remote village located in Nigeria, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 171643-171663, (2020); Roy K., Chatterjee A., Chatterjee D., Ganguli A.K., A photovoltaic-based improved excitation control strategy of three-phase self-excited induction generator suitable for wind power generation, Electric Power Components and Systems, 43, 17, pp. 1912-1920, (2015); Musarrat M.N., Fekih A., A fault-tolerant control framework for DFIG-based wind energy conversion systems in a hybrid wind/pv microgrid, IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics, 9, 6, pp. 7237-7252, (2021); Suresh Kumar L.V., Nagesh Kumar G.V., Power conversion in renewable energy systems: A review advances in wind and PV system, International Journal of Energy Research, 41, 2, pp. 182-197, (2017); Chauhan A., Saini R.P., Techno-economic optimization-based approach for energy man-agement of a stand-alone integrated renewable energy system for remote areas of India, Energy, 94, pp. 138-156, (2016); Borowy B.S., Salameh Z.M., Methodology for optimally sizing the combination of a battery bank and PV array in a wind/PV hybrid system, IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion, 11, 2, pp. 367-375, (1996); Musa I., Gadoue S., Zahawi B., Integration of induction generator based distributed generation in power distribution networks using a discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm, Electric Power Components and Systems, 44, 3, pp. 268-277, (2016); Hossain M.J., Pota H.R., Mahmud M.A., Aldeen M., Robust control for power sharing in microgrids with low-inertia wind and PV generators, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 6, 3, pp. 1067-1077, (2015); Benali A., Khiat M., Allaoui T., Denai M., Power quality improvement and low voltage ride through capability in hybrid wind-PV farms grid-connected using dynamic voltage restorer, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 68634-68648, (2018); Pahasa J., Ngamroo L., Two-stage optimization based on SOC control of SMES installed in hybrid wind/PV system for stabilizing voltage and power fluctuations, IEEE Trans.

It provides electricity by coupling photovoltaic/thermal collectors and a micro-wind turbine, fresh water by means of hybrid desalination (membrane distillation, and reverse osmosis), and sanitary hot water coming from the photovoltaic/thermal collectors and an evacuated tubes collector. Plant was designed to operate in off-grid conditions and conventional energy storage systems were used (lead acid batteries and hot water tank). Simulation model was performed in TRNSYS environment and it was fully validated by comparing several key plant measurements. The analysis was focused on five typical days of summer, fall and winter. Some differences found in experimental and simulated values were analysed. To reduce those gaps, some modifications have been suggested to the model or the pilot unit respectively. As a result, a validated model in TRNSYS of the plant was obtained. This model can be used for the further scale up of new projects to cover any other scheduled demands of power and water in isolated areas, whenever is based on the combination of the abovementioned technologies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Desalination; Experimental validation; Hybrid systems; Renewable sources; Simulation; Trigeneration","Desalination; Distillation; Electric energy storage; Solar collectors; Water; Water tanks; Energy storage systems; Experimental test; Hybrid renewable energies; Membrane distillation; Micro-wind turbines; Photovoltaic/thermal; Plant measurement; Trigeneration schemes; desalination; design; distillation; energy storage; experimental study; model validation; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; reverse osmosis; smart grid; wind turbine; Lead acid batteries","","","","","Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness, (ENE2014-59947-R); Gobierno de Aragón","This work has been supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness (R + D Project ENE2014-59947-R ) and the Government of Aragón (Research Group T28-17R ).

Samples of one of the affected monocrystalline silicon cells were cored and extracted from the module packaging and encapsulation. One of the cell fragments was processed using a regeneration cycle of applying short-circuit-rated current in forward bias at 85°C for 2 weeks, while the other fragment was kept in its outdoor-degraded LeTID state. Both samples were scribed to form 2-mm diameter isolated areas using a femtosecond-pulse-width laser micromachining system. Both isolated areas contained front grid line segments which were wire bonded to larger contact pads, and the samples were probed in a cryostat linked to a deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) system. Using DLTS, a majority-carrier, hole-trap defect was detected on each sample with an activation energy of 0.42 eV. The LeTID-degraded sample, however, had a larger signal corresponding to a trap density of 1.1x1013 cm-3, which was about five times larger than the 2.1x1012 cm-3 trap density of the regenerated sample. © 2021 IEEE.","charge carrier lifetime; degradation; laser ablation; Photovoltaic cells; semiconductor impurities; solar panels","Activation energy; Carrier lifetime; Cells; Cytology; Deep level transient spectroscopy; Electromagnetic pulse; Laser ablation; Laser pulses; Monocrystalline silicon; Photovoltaic cells; Semiconductor lasers; Solar power generation; Charge carrier lifetime; Deep levels transient spectroscopy; Elevated temperature; Induced degradation; Lasers ablations; Photovoltaic systems; Semiconductor impurity; Solar panels; Temperature-induced; Trap density; Photoelectrochemical cells","","","","","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-AC36-08GO28308); Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EERE; National Renewable Energy Laboratory, NREL; Solar Energy Technologies Office, SETO, (34357)","Funding text 1: This work was authored in part by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, operated by Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC, for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308.

Over time, the cost of these systems has decreased, providing greater accessibility to freshwater in areas far from urban centers and power grids. This paper proposes a novel sustainability analysis of the groundwater pumping systems in Tenerife Island as an example of a medium-size isolated system, analyzing the current status and the business-as-usual projection to 2030, considering the water reservoirs available and the final use of water. The 2030 projection focused on the PV deployment, evaluation of the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), and the availability of the groundwater resource. HOMER software was used to analyze the LCOE, and ArcGIS software was used for the visual modeling of water resources. As a result, the average LCOE for a purely PV installation supplying electricity to a pumping system in Tenerife is 0.2430 €/kWh, but the location and characteristic of each pumping system directly affect the performance and costs, mostly due to the solar availability. © 2022 by the authors.","2030 scenario; groundwater pumping; LCOE; photovoltaic applications; Tenerife","Electric power transmission networks; Groundwater; Pumping plants; Pumps; Reservoirs (water); Sustainable development; 2030 scenario; Case-studies; Groundwater pumping; Levelized cost of electricities; Photovoltaic applications; Photovoltaic energy; Pumping systems; Sustainability analysis; Tenerife; Tenerife island; Groundwater resources","","","","","Fundación CajaCanarias, (2019SP25); Universidad de La Laguna, ULL","This research was funded by the CajaCanarias Foundation, grant number 2019SP25, and Cátedra de Medio Ambiente y Desarrollo Sostenible from the University of La Laguna.","Pimentel D., Burgess M., World Human Population Problems, Encyclopedia of the Anthropocene, pp. 313-317, (2018); El Estado de La Seguridad Alimentaria y La Nutrición en el Mundo 2019, (2019); Water for a Sustainable World (2022 Report); Mexico Una Cuarta Parte de La Población Mundial Padece Escasez de Agua|WRI Mexico; 17 Países, Hogar de Una Cuarta Parte de La Población Mundial, Enfrentan un Estrés Hídrico Extremadamente Alto; Ranking the World’s Most Water-Stressed Countries in 2040|World Resources Institute; Informe Mundial de Las Naciones Unidas Sobre el Desarrollo de Los Recursos Hídricos 2019.

Each configuration of photovoltaic systems has advantages and disadvantages compared to the other, which are reviewed so that the reader has a clear idea of the convenience of implementing this type of systems. The document reviews commercial software for the simulation, analysis, and sizing of renewable energy systems, selecting two software’s for the sizing and comparison of centralized and decentralized systems. Simulation results indicate that the centralized system has a lower energy cost, however the software analyzed does not consider the laying costs of the micro-network distribution lines of the case or study or distribution losses. The cost of energy in the decentralized system is $0.66/kWh and 0.64 $/kWh for centralized, centralized installations require fewer batteries to store surplus energy produced by photovoltaic panels. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Communities; Decentralization; Electrification; Energy cost; Renewable energy","Computer software; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Centralised; Community; Decentralisation; Decentralised; Electricity grids; Electricity supply; Energy cost; Photovoltaic generation system; Renewable energies; Safe electricity; Decentralized systems","","","","","","","Yaqoot M., Diwan P., Kandpal T.C., Review of barriers to the dissemination of decentralized renewable energy systems, Renew.

The photovoltaic water pumping system is one of the best alternative irrigation methods. This article presents a procedure for estimating the appropriate size of a photovoltaic system designed to power a pumping system for four irrigation methods (surface, sprinkler, drip, and developed surface irrigation) under different climate conditions for summer of three crops (cotton, thin corn, and soybean) and for winter of three crops (wheat, Bean and Barley). The solar simulation model estimated the hydraulic power, photovoltaic (PV) peak power, PV required area, total system costs and specific water demand according to the type of crop under different irrigation methods in three different geographical locations in Egypt at a different total dynamic head 50,100, and 200 m. As a comparison between the required water demand in several irrigation systems, it is found that the percentage of the amount of water demand per Fadden (m3/F) related to surface irrigation system for summer crops such as cotton crop was 85.7%, 79.9%, 66.7% in developed surface, sprinkler, and drip irrigation respectively. While in case of thin corn crop was 74.3%, 79.9%, 66.7% and for Soybean was 85.7%, 79.9%, 66.6%, respectively.

More than 300 homes are concerned by this alternative solution that these microgrids represent. Presented data come from an experimental microgrid between 3 homes at the place called « Roche Plate », where electrical production is obtained by photovoltaic panels and storage by batteries. Local data are collected to simulate electrical systems and determine the optimal working point of energy distribution. These data concern the meteorological conditions, the electrical performance of devices and the inhabitants’ usage of appliances. A weather station placed on the solar plant gives the meteorological conditions of this enclave region. Daily loads for the three families are measured and all the data are stored for analysis. A continuous period of one year of measurements is available for the community and is shared throughout this data paper. These datasets will be completed later.

This system aims to small farmers in Chile seek the water resource, particularly those in isolated areas which suffer from the problem of the prolonged ""mega-drought"" that has affected the country since 2010, furthermore the irrigation methods used are not very accessible. In this context, this article accounts for the technological solutions to the irrigation system powered by photovoltaic system that Tecnored has designed to supply energy for small farmers who are out of connection to the grid, contrasting their advantages, disadvantages, and installation costs, with focus on supplying electricity for a daytime irrigation system for 10 years. The study shows that, due to its modularity, ease of maintenance, long service life and low cost, as well as Chile's unique solar conditions, and the government incentives, photovoltaic technology with variable frequency inverters is the most suitable choice for small farmer far from the grid. In addition, the solution is consistent with Chile's commitment to Climate Change and is the most commercially attractive one, which can add product value to clean agricultural production. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.","CHILE; GREEN ENERGY; PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEM; SMALL FARMERS; WATER PUMP","Climate change; Electric power systems; Solar power generation; Water resources; CHILE; Energy supply system; Green energy; Irrigation systems; Photovoltaic energy; Photovoltaic systems; SMALL FARMERS; Technological solution; Tecnored; Water pump; Irrigation","","","","","","","Semedo Helena, FAO Deputy Director-General: 'Global Bioeconomy Summit Statement, Global Bioeconomy Summit, (2015); Chilean Ministry of Energy - Solar Energy Training Program Photovoltaic For Technical Meddle Education Liceos Professional'; Drought: The challenges for Chile of a future with less water; INDAP: Seminar: ""Rethinking small agriculture to face water scarcity scenarios; Ministry of Energy: Energy Vulnerability Map; AChEE: Energy Scenario of the Agrifood Sector'; 'Ministry of energy: Guide to good and bad practices in SFV for irrigation; 'CNE:TECHNICAL STANDARD OF SERVICE QUALITY FOR DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, Title 3-1, article 3-1 voltage regulation'; CNE:Average Market Price; Parity price table; Donoso Guillermo, Proposal for Chile 2016: Chapter V Potable water fee system in Chile: a proposal to improve its sustainability (Centro UC); CEN: Emission Factors; Chilean generators: Electric Market; INDAP: FAMILY FARMER IN CHILE AND INDAP USERS; Contribution of the sector to Chile's economy by 2030","F.

The system includes multiple energy sources connected to a DC bus through DC/DC converters for maximum power point tracking. The proposed hybrid MPPT approach (HMPPT) manages the energy production from different sources, while the power flow method is used to balance the load and renewable power. The study shows that integrating the HMPPT algorithm and power flow approach results in improved system performance, including increased power generation and reduced stress on the batteries. The study also proposes an accurate sizing method to further improve system efficiency. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach by presenting results for twelve different days with varying weather conditions. The results show that the proposed approach effectively manages the energy production and load, resulting in optimal system performance.

EO is selected to design the microgrid system due to its high effectiveness in determining the optimal solution in very short time. EO is presented for selecting the optimal system design which can minimize the cost, improve the system stability, and cover the load at different climate conditions. Microgrid system consists of photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT), battery, and diesel generator. The objective function treated in this paper is to minimize the net present cost (NPC), respecting several constraints such as the reliability, availability, and renewable fraction. The sensitivity analysis is conducted in two stages: Firstly, the impact of wind speed, solar radiation, interest rate, and diesel fuel on the NPC, and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is analyzed. Secondly, the influence of size variation on loss of power supply probability (LPSP) is investigated. The results obtained by EO are compared with those obtained by recent metaheuristics optimization algorithms, namely, Harris Hawks Optimizer (HHO), Artificial Electric Field Algorithm (AEFA), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Sooty Tern Optimization Algorithm (STOA). The results show that the optimal system design is achieved by the proposed EO, where renewable energy sources (PV and WT) represent 97% of the annual contribution and fast convergence characteristics are obtained by EO. The best NPC, LCOE, and LPSP are obtained via EO achieving 74327, 0.0917/kWh, and 0.0489, respectively.  © 2013 IEEE.","Economic energy; energy storage; hybrid renewable energy system; microgrid; net present cost; optimal system design; optimization algorithms; PV panels; solar energy; wind energy","Availability; Cost benefit analysis; Diesel engines; Electric fields; Microgrids; Optimal systems; Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; System stability; Systems analysis; Wind; Climate condition; Diesel generators; Loss of power supply probability; Micro-grid systems; Objective functions; Optimal solutions; Optimization algorithms; Renewable energy source; Optimization","","","","","Korea Electric Power Corporation, KEPCO","This work was supported by Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO)—Development of Modular Green Substation and Operation Technology.","Maleki A., Pourfayaz F., Hafeznia H., Rosen M.A., A novel framework for optimal photovoltaic size and location in remote areas using a hybrid method: A case study of eastern Iran, Energy Convers.

However, the power produced by photovoltaic modules varies depending on the instantaneous irradiations and temperature in site besides load characteristics. Thus, Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) strategies are used to extract the maximum power from the modules. In this paper, a Modified PSO algorithm (MPSO) is used to track the MPP of a PV system under partial shading conditions. The proposed MPSO has more efficient exploration and exploitation phases compared to the traditional PSO due to its variable cooperation and self-memory parameters. MPSO is compared with a classical MPPT technique and the conventional PSO algorithm. MPSO shows superior capabilities in terms of tracking speed and efficiency. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Metaheuristic algorithms; MPPT techniques; Partial shading conditions; Particle swarm optimization; Photovoltaic","Costs; Electric loads; Maximum power point trackers; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Solar panels; Condition; Maximum power point tracking techniques; Meta-heuristics algorithms; Partial shading; Partial shading condition; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Photovoltaics; PSO algorithms; Swarm optimization; Solar energy","","","","","","","Ahmed J., Salam Z., A critical evaluation on maximum power point tracking methods for partial shading in PV systems, Renew.

The present study describes potential of the AWH from low-humid regions under the climatic conditions of Hail city (27.64° N, 41.75° E) in Saudi Arabia. Trapezoidal prism solar still of 5-shelves is developed, where the shelves are filled with black cotton cloth bed saturated with calcium chloride solution. The solar still is opened during night hours, enabling the descant to absorb humidity from humid air (absorption process) and closed during day hours causing desorption of water under higher temperatures (regeneration process). The vapor condensates on a glass surface and is collected in a bottle. Under low-humid conditions of the Hail city, the desiccant balanced approximately at 48% saturation concentration. The water production of the device reaches 1.06 l/m2day by consuming 22.96 MJ solar energy/l of water with a cost of $0.055 per liter. The present study has demonstrated high potential of the AWH technique from low-humid regions up to 26.5%. The proposed device is standalone with promising performance, which needs neither the natural water resources nor the infrastructure. The device is suitable for remote and isolated small communities. © 2020, International Association for Mathematical Geosciences.","AWH; Calcium chloride; Desiccant; Low humidity; Multi-shelves; Solar still","","","","","","University of Ha?il; University of Ha’il, (BA-1920)","Funding text 1: This research has been funded by Scientific Research Deanship at University of Ha’il, Saudi Arabia (BA-1920, 2019).

Renewable energy sources are present, with huge quantities, free access, and without a negative impact on the environment. The electricity produced by renewable energies is gradually becoming economically and technically advantageous. In most cases, integrating a single source of renewable energy can lead to over-sizing and therefore a very expensive implementation. To remedy this, systems consisting of one or numerous renewable energy sources are adopted in order to guarantee maximum electricity production as well as practical reliability at encouraging costs. In addition, the electricity generated by renewable energy sources such as wind turbines, solar, biomass, geothermal energy … has a particular interest in isolated spaces. This chapter provides an updated literature review about Off-grid PV-Based Hybrid Renewable Energy System for electricity generation in remote areas. First, after the introduction, a presentation of the world energy situation was discussed in order to see the progress of the implementation of renewable energies on a global scale. Secondly, a section was reserved for renewable energy alternatives in order to discuss each source separately, before starting the part devoted to off-grid hybrid renewable energy structures. These structures have been examined in a large number of researches works with the aim of electrifying remote areas in several countries of the world. Finally, a detailed presentation of the main reliability, economic, and environmental performance indices is given for the evaluation of these systems. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Hybrid renewable energy systems (HRESs);

The thermoelectric cooling module consumes 70 W, it is supplied by a photovoltaic system of 90 W and 40 Ah battery. The voltage and electrical current in each component (panels, battery, and electric charge) has been measured. The tests were performed with different thermal loads placed in glass containers used for vaccines. To analyze the cooling and preservation process, the experiments were started at room temperature. The results show that the thermoelectric cooling system works for small thermal loads, and it could be applied to transport vaccines in isolated areas where people carry medicines in small containers that do not maintain the temperature necessary for the conservation of vaccines.  © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.","","Containers; Cooling systems; Electric batteries; Medicine; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Thermal load; Thermoelectric equipment; Thermoelectric refrigeration; Vaccines; Electrical current; Glass containers; Isolated community; Photovoltaic solar energy; Photovoltaic systems; Small containers; Thermoelectric cooling; Thermoelectric cooling technology; Thermal management (electronics)","","","","","","","Zuazua-Ros A., Martin-Gomez C., Ibanez-Puy E., Vidaurre-Arbizu M., Gelbstein Y., Investigation of the thermoelectric potential for heating, cooling and ventilation in buildings: Characterization options and applications, Renew.

This prevailed to search for other options like extending grid or using diesel generators (DG), batteries, etc., to meet the day to day needs of isolated communities. Due to environmental effects, such as greenhouse gas emission, global warming and climate change, etc., has turned our focus on green energy. The purpose of this work is to suggest the feasible hybrid green energy sources for generation of power from a different combination of green sources to fulfil the energy demands of a remote village called Sadivayal, Coimbatore in Southern India. To identify the optimal solution, this paper uses the software called hybrid optimization model for electric renewables (HOMER). The obtained solution shows the hybrid combination of solar-wind-hydro-battery is a sustainable, cost effective and environment friendly alternative source which also mitigates the CO2 emission and other greenhouse gas emissions. © 2020 - Kalpana Corporation","Environmental effects; Feasibility; Greenhouse gas emission; Hybrid optimization model for electric renewables; Hybrid renewable energy source","","","","","","","","Basu Analjyoti, Sahoo Saumyaranjan, Rural electrification using renewable energy in India: Operational issues and challenges with photovoltaic power plants, (2016); Kaur T., Segal R., Designing rural electrification solutions considering hybrid energy systems for Papua New Guinea, Energy Procedía, 110, pp. 1-7, (2017); Markvart T., Sizing of hybrid photovoltaic-wind energy systems, Solar Energy, 57, 4, pp. 277-281, (1996); McGowan J.G., Hybrid wind/pv/diesel hybrid power systems modeling and South American applications, WREC; Energy access programmes and sustainable development: A critical review and analysis, Energy for Sustainable Develop, 16, 3, pp. 260-271, (2012); CO2 emissions from fuel combustion highlights, (2014); Panwar N.L., Kaushik S.C., Kothari Surendra, Role of renewable energy sources in environmental protection: A review, J.

Solar PV continues to supplement the main grid in powering both commercial establishments (mainly for reduced electricity expense) as well as residential houses in isolated areas (for basic energy requirement such as for lighting purposes). The objective of this study is to assess the available solar PV power (PPV) potential considering the effects of high temperature, dust and snow in the Asia Pacific region. The PPV potential was estimated considering the effects of the said meteorological parameters using several satellite data including shortwave radiation from Advanced Himawari Imager 8 (AHI8), MOD04 aerosol data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), precipitation rate from Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), air temperature from NCEP/DOE AMIP-II Reanalysis-2 data, and snow water equivalent (SWE) from Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). The model is validated by comparing its outputs with the measured PV power from two solar PV installations in Bangkok, Thailand and Perth, Australia. Results show that maximum PPV is estimated at 2.5 GW (cell efficiency of 17.47%) for the region with the maximum decrease in PPV estimated to be about < 2%, 22% and 100% due to high temperature (temperature coefficient of power Combining double low line 0.47%/K), dust and snow, respectively. Moreover, areas in India and Northern China were observed to experience the effects of both dust and temperature during March-April-May (MAM) season. Meanwhile, countries located in the higher latitudes were severely affected by snow while Australia by high temperature during Dec-Jan-Feb (DJF) season. The model has a mean percentage prediction error (PPE) range of 5% to18% and 7% to 23% in seasonal and monthly estimations, respectively. Outputs from this study can be used by stakeholders of solar PV in planning for small-scale or large-scale solar PV projects in the solar rich region of Asia Pacific. © 2020 Authors.","AHI8; AMSR-E; dust; GSMaP; MODIS; snow; Solar PV power; temperature","Atmospheric temperature; Dust; Energy utilization; Radiation effects; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Snow; Solar power generation; Temperature; AHI8; Commercial establishments; GSMaP; Meteorological parameters; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; MODIS; Solar photovoltaic system; Solar PVs; Solar cells","","","","","CLOT; SWR; Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, JAXA; Hitachi Global Foundation","The authors would wish to thank the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) for the SWR, CLOT and GSMaP products supplied by the P-tree System; and the Hitachi Global Foundation for their support in this research endeavor.","Energy Sector Strategy: Sustainable Energy for Asia, (2017); Average Annual & Monthly Sunshine Duration, (2016); Cotton W.R., Bryan G., Van Den S.C., Radiative transfer in a cloudy atmosphere and its parameterization, International Geophysics, 44, pp. 148-189, (1992); Frouin R., Murakami H., Estimating photosynthetically available radiation at the ocean surface from adeos-ii global imager data, Journal of Oceanography, 63, pp. 493-503, (2007); Goossens D., Offer Z.A.Z., Wind tunnel experiments and field investigations of eolian dust deposition on photovoltaic solar collectors, Solar Energy, 50, pp. 75-84, (1993); Hall D.K., Riggs G.A., Salomonson V.V., Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) for the MODIS Snow and Sea Ice-Mapping Algorithms, (2001); Kim J., Kim D., Yoo W., Lee J., Kim Y.B., Daily prediction of solar power generation based on weather forecast information in korea, IET Renew.

This makes their life even more difficult in these isolated areas and creates a hindrance in their holistic development. In this paper, an optimized solar photo voltaic (SPV)/wind energy conversion(WEC)/biogas generator (BGG)/biomass generator (BMG)/micro hydropower system (MHPS)/battery based integrated renewable energy model(IREM) is suggested for satisfying the energy need of different load sectors of the Mori Block, Uttarakashi district, Uttarakhand State, India. An extensive investigation has been done for accessing the demand and potential of locally available renewable energy sources. Genetic Algorithm (GA) technique has been utilized for optimizing various energy cost and emission parameters such as; cost of energy (CE), cost of generation (CG), cost of total energy (COTE), and CO2 emission. The suggested energy model is not only ensures the availability of reliable and economic power supply but also significantly limits the environmental degradation caused by the diesel generator operation in terms of CO2 emission. Further, the suggested optimization technique is also compared with other techniques for establishing its effectiveness in the field of isolated hilly areas electrification and holistic development. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CO<sub>2</sub> emission; Cost of energy; Cost of generation; Cost of total energy","Carbon dioxide; Energy conversion; Genetic algorithms; Natural resources; CO 2 emission; Cost of energies; Cost of generation; Cost of total energy; Energy cost; Energy model; Hilly areas; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Total energy; Renewable energy resources","","","","","","","Wagh M.M., Kulkarni V.V., Modeling and optimization of integration of renewable energy resources (RER) for minimum energy cost, minimum CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and sustainable development in recent years: a review, Proc.

The main objective of this study is to access the structural strength performance of a photovoltaic (PV)/Wind hybrid system for applications in isolated area. Therefore, this study requires two steps. First part involves modelling of the three-dimensional (3D) assembly of PV-Wind hybrid structure using Computer Aided Design (CAD) software, namely, SOLIDWORKS (version 2016) and the second part involves in static response analysis subjected to the critical wind (Eurocode 1991-1-4 standard) and gravitational loads by using finite element (FE) method (SOLIDWORKS Simulation). The results from this analysis identify that the static strength and stability are qualified (no structural failure). © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Finite element analysis; PV/wind hybrid system; Renewable energy; Static analysis","","","","","","","","Ekren O., Ekren B.Y., Size optimization of a PV/wind hybrid energy conversion system with battery storage using simulated annealing, Appl.

Usually, those microgrids use renewable energy power plants such as solar PV. This is also in line with the Indonesia Government's step to deploy more renewable energy in its power generation system to reduce Greenhouse Gasses Emissions. One of the several microgrids with solar PV plants already been implemented in Indonesia is Karampuang Island Microgrid. Currently, their electricity supply by four Solar PV microgrids which are separated and not connected yet. In this study, two schemes of Karampuang microgrid expansion are examined. The first scheme uses a single Solar PV power plant and a battery energy storage system (BESS). The size of the Solar PV plant and BESS is the total capacity of the current condition. The second scheme is the microgrid using four distributed solar PV power plants in their current location and capacity. The Solar PV connect among them to supply the island's load in one grid. The power quality of both microgrid schemes is examined. The power quality phenomena, i.e. total harmonic distortion and temporary overvoltage of both schemes, are examined by Matlab/Simulink software simulation. The THD and temporary overvoltage in Distributed Solar PV microgrid is better than the single solar PV microgrid. © 2021 IEEE.","Distributed Solar PV; Microgrid; Power Quality; Temporary Overvoltage; THD","Electric energy storage; Electrolysis; MATLAB; Microgrids; Battery energy storage systems; Distributed solar PV; Indonesia; Microgrid; PV plants; PV Power plants; Solar PV microgrid; Solar PVs; Temporary overvoltages; THD; Power quality","","","","","Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education; Lembaga Pengelola Dana Pendidikan, LPDP","This work funded by Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP)","Plts jadi program prioritas genjot target ebt, Ebtke.esdm.go.id, (2021); Vinayagam A., Aziz A., Swarna K.S.V., Khoo S., Stojcevski A., Power quality impacts in a typical microgrid, Int.

Therefore, solar energy is a real alternative, as it supplies virtually unlimited energy. Solar desalination could be an ideal solution for isolated areas which receive high solar irradiation per day. Solar Membrane Distillation (MD) is a developing technology particularly interesting for small supplies, isolated populations and autonomous systems. As it is a low temperature operation process, MD is very suitable for integration with thermal solar systems and/or waste heat recovery units; in contrast to other desalination technologies, only a coarse filtration of the water is required as pretreatment. However, the commercial availability is currently quite limited. This paper presents the promising 5-year experience and data analysis of a solar compact MD demonstration plant installed in the facilities of the Instituto Tecnológico de Canarias (ITC) in Playa de Pozo Izquierdo (Gran Canary Island-Spain).The unit was designed and installed at the end of 2004 as part of a co-funded FP6 DGTREN research project called 'Development of stand-alone, solar thermally driven and PV-supplied desalination systems based on innovative membrane distillation' (MEMDIS) and has been continuously tested within the FP7 EU co-funded project called 'MEmbrane DIstillation in Remote AreaS - MEDIRAS'. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Membrane distillation; Performance; Pilot plant operation; Solar energy","Canary Islands; Gran Canaria; Las Palmas; Spain; Desalination; Energy management; Low temperature operations; Pilot plants; Solar energy; Autonomous systems; Coarse filtration; Commercial availability; Demonstration plants; Desalination systems; Desalination technologies; Fossil sources; High energy; Ideal solutions; Isolated areas; Low temperatures; Membrane distillation; Operational experience; Performance; Pilot plant operation; Pre-Treatment; Remote areas; Solar desalination; Solar irradiation; Thermal solar system; Thermally driven; Waste heat recovery units; distillation; innovation; irradiation; membrane; performance assessment; solar power; technological development; waste facility; Water filtration","","","","","Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (218938); European Commission, EC, (NNE5-2001-00819)","The authors wish to thank the European Commission for their financial assistance with the MEMDIS project – Development of stand-alone, solar thermally driven and PV-supplied desalination system based on innovative membrane distillation (NNE5-2001-00819) and for [12] – MEmbrane DIstillation in Remote AreaS (TREN/FP7EN/218938).

Stand-alone projects that combine the wind and photovoltaic generation technologies as well as microgrids and individual supplies for the distribution network are an adequate strategy to reach such isolated regions. However, the design of electrification projects is complex, having to define the best combination of generation and distribution technologies, under a challenging social context and tight technoeconomic resources. In order to ease decision-making, several tools have been developed in the literature and are here reviewed, grouped into three main categories: optimization processes, aiming to minimize project costs subject to technical constraints, through exact or heuristic algorithms; multicriteria processes, using different methods to select the best among a set of predefined scenarios according to economic, technical, social, and environmental criteria; and systematized tools, that have been developed to provide user-friendly interface for their larger dissemination in different regions and contexts. Hence, this paper aims to provide researchers and practitioners an analysis of the advantages and limitations of approaches used over the last decade when addressing the designing of wind and/or photovoltaic electrification projects for extremely poor and isolated areas in developing countries, as well as some areas for further research.

The particularity of this purification plant is that it should be autonomous to work in isolated areas. To do so, the design counts on solar panels and batteries controlled by a Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. The main objective of this study is the design and automation of the purification power plant so it can be used either manually or remotely by means of a web server and a micro controller in charge of data collection and to proceed orders from and to the web platform. In pursue of a cost reduction, caused by the development and implementation of hardware and software, this project is conceived using open source systems. Additionally, the plant counts on an Energy Management System that should optimize the energy consumption of the control system and actuators. This system is designed in such a way that it can be used independently in isolated mode or connected to the grid in regions where local authority regulations allows the connection of energy storage systems to the grid. © 2018 Desalination Publications.

With augmented significance on eco-friendly technologies the use of renewable energy sources such as micro-hydro, wind, solar, biomass and biogas is being explored. This paper presents an extensive review on various issues related to Integrated Renewable Energy System (IRES) based power generation. Issues related to integration configurations, storage options, sizing methodologies and system control for energy flow management are discussed in detail. For stand-alone applications integration of renewable energy sources, performed through DC coupled, AC coupled or hybrid DC-AC coupled configurations, are studied in detail. Based on the requirement of storage duration in isolated areas, storage technology options can be selected for integrated systems. Uncertainties involved in designing an effective IRES based power generation system for isolated areas is accounted due to highly dynamic nature of availability of sources and the demand at site. Different methodologies adopted and reported in literature for sizing of the system components are presented. Distributed control, centralized and hybrid control schemes for energy flow management in IRES have also been discussed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Demand; Integrated system; Load; Renewable energy; Stand-alone applications","Distributed parameter control systems; Integrated control; Loading; Natural resources; Demand; Generation of electric power; Integrated renewable energy systems; Integrated systems; Integration configurations; Renewable energies; Standalone applications; Use of renewable energies; Renewable energy resources","","","","","","","Ramakumar R., Integrated renewable energy systems: Power engineering review, IEEE, 15, 2, pp. 10-13, (1995); Ramakumar R., Abouzahr I., Ashenay K.A., Knowledge-based approach to the design of integrated renewable energy systems, IEEE Trans Energy Convers, 10, pp. 736-746, (1995); Ramakumar R., Shetty P.Sudhakara, Ashenayi K., Linear programming approach to the design of integrated renewable energy systems for developing countries, IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion, EC-1, 4, pp. 18-24, (1986); Kanase Patil A.B., Saini R.P., Sharma M.P., Integrated renewable energy systems for off grid rural electrification of remote area, Renew Energy, 5, pp. 1342-1349, (2013); Ashenayi K., Ramakumar R., IRES a program to design integrated renewable energy systems, Energy, 15, pp. 1143-1152, (1990); Ramakumar R., Abouzahr I., Krishnan K., Ashenayi K., Design scenarios for integrated renewable energy systems, IEEE Trans Energy Convers, 10, pp. 736-746, (1995); Lasseter R., Abbas A., Marnay C., Stevens J., Dagle J., Guttromson R., Et al., Integration of distributed energy resources: The CERTS Microgrid Concept California Energy Commission, (2003); Farret F.A., Simoes M.G., Integration of Alternative Sources of Energy, (2006); Sao C.K., Lehn P.W., A transformerless energy storage system based on a cascade multilevel PWM converter with star configuration, IEEE Trans Ind Appl, 44, 5, pp. 1621-1630, (2008); Sood P.K., Lipo T.A., Hansen I.G., A versatile power converter for high-frequency link systems, IEEE Trans Power Electron, 3, 4, pp. 383-390, (1988); Barton J.P., Infield D.G., Energy storage and its use with intermittent renewable energy, IEEE Trans Energy Convers, 19, pp. 441-448, (2004); Makansi J., Abboud A., Energy Storage.

By connecting diesel generator and battery system to solar-photovoltaic or wind-turbine based generators, several benefits are obtained: higher reliability, energy quality and less oscillations in energy delivery. In this work, a photovoltaic-diesel-battery hybrid system in Tapajós-Arapiuns extractive reserve in Brazil is studied. That hybrid system is formed by a photovoltaic generator, battery system, diesel generator and isolated loads that are variable throughout the year. For that purpose, HOMER software was employed, so load-following and cycle-charging dispatch strategies were analysed with hourly-based data for a typical year. Results showed that load-following dispatch strategy is the best option, leading to energy productions of about 85.6% from the photovoltaic generator and 14.4% from the diesel generator. © 2019 IEEE.","battery; Diesel generator; HOMER; Hybrid energy system; Photovoltaic","Diesel engines; Electric power transmission networks; Hybrid systems; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Smart power grids; Solar power generation; battery; Diesel generators; HOMER; Hybrid energy system; Photovoltaic; Electric load dispatching","","","","","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (2016/08645-9); CPFL, (PD-00063-3043/2018)","This work was supported by the agencies CNPq, CAPES and FAPESP (2016/08645-9), CPFL (PD-00063-3043/2018) and BYD ENERGY through the PADIS program.

A stand-alone photovoltaic (PV)system can be particularly impactful in an isolated area where access to the grid is limited or unavailable. Because solar energy generation primarily depends on the availability of solar irradiance over time, energy management is crucial, which in turn can also satisfy user comfort and system efficiency. In this paper, we propose an energy consumption scheduling model for a residential house with a stand-alone PV system and battery. We develop a mixed-integer optimization model that uses consumption patterns and appliance priority to schedule the use of appliances. We test our model under four scenarios based on region and season. The results demonstrate that the proposed model provides optimal schedules for operating the appliances. In addition, we conduct a sensitivity analysis on the PV array size and the battery capacity. We compare the optimized case with the non-optimized case. © 2019 International Solar Energy Society","Battery Size; Mixed-integer programming; Optimal energy scheduling; Stand-alone PV system","Electric batteries; Housing; Integer programming; Photovoltaic cells; Scheduling; Sensitivity analysis; Solar energy; Battery size; Consumption patterns; Mixed integer optimization; Mixed integer programming; Optimal energy; Renewable energy source; Stand alone photovoltaic system; Stand-alone PV systems; alternative energy; energy resource; equipment; linear programing; photovoltaic system; power generation; sensitivity analysis; solar power; solar radiation; Energy utilization","","","","","","","Agnetis A., de Pascale G., Detti P., Vicino A., Load scheduling for household energy consumption optimization, IEEE Trans.

The cost of DPP producing energy is 0.25-2.0 Euro/kWh, which is significantly more expensive than in the areas with centralized power. Therefore, reducing the consumption of the imported DPP fuel is an important socio-economic problem.

However, electric pumps cannot be employed in areas which are not connected to the public electric distribution grid. Such isolated areas demand the need for electric pumps fed by renewable energy sources such as solar systems. The solar energy fed water pumping systems have thus attained increased attention in recent times. A solar powered water pumping system employing an improved asymmetric converter fed Switched Reluctance Motor is proposed. It provides an efficient and cost effective PV based water pumping system. An improved asymmetrical half bridge converter with reduced cost and volume is used to switch the SRM. MPPT controller is used to enhance the PVG output power and keep it maximum at varying irradiance. Landsman converter acts as a DC to DC converter between PV system and motor-pump drive.

Hence in this paper, centrifugal pump driven by three-phase induction motor is considered. To power the three-phase induction motor, a three-phase voltage source inverter is used which performs two functions, viz., (i) converts the Maximum Power-Point dc voltage into three-phase ac voltage (ii) changes the frequency of the three-phase ac voltage and helps the system to guide at the Maximum Power Point. © 2018 IEEE.","Photovoltaic (PV); Three-phase induction motor (IM); Three-phase voltage source inverter","DC motors; Electric inverters; Electric power transmission networks; Photovoltaic cells; Solar power generation; Carbon brush; Maximum power point; Photovoltaic; Pv water pumping systems; Solar photovoltaic system; Three phase induction motor; Three-phase ac voltage; Three-phase voltage source inverters; Induction motors","","","","","","","Raju A.B., Ramesh Karnik S., Jyothi R., Analysis of a single stage inverter with maximum power point tracker for photovoltaic water pumping system, IEEE 2010 (2011. 01. 28-2); Packiam P., Jain N.K., Singh I.P., Steady and Transient Characteristics of A Single Stage PV Water Pumping System, (2014); Muljadi E., PV water pumping with a peak-power tracker using a simple six-step square-wave inverter, IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 33, 3, pp. 714-721, (1997); Mostafa Saied M., Matching of DC motors to photovoltaic generators for maximum daily gross mechanical energy, IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion, 3, 3, pp. 465-472, (1988); Appelbaum J., Sarma M.S., The operation of permanent magnet DC motors powered by a common source of solar cells, IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion, 4, 4, pp. 635-642, (1989); Appelbaum J., The operation of loads powered by separate sources or by a common source of solar cells, IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion, 4, 3, pp. 351-357, (1989); Alghuwainem S.M., Steady-state performance of DC motors supplied from photovoltaic generators with step-up converter, IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion, 7, 2, pp. 267-272, (1992); Bhat S.R., Pittet A., Sonde B.S., Performance optimization of induction motor-pump system using photovoltaic energy source, IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, IA-23, 6, pp. 995-1000, (1987); Krishnan R., Electric Motor Drives, Modelling, Analysis and Control, (2001); Mohan N., Undland T.M., Robbins W.P., Power Electronics Converters, Application and Design, (2003); Krause P.C., Analysis of Electric Machinery, (1986)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2018 International Conference on Current Trends towards Converging Technologies, ICCTCT 2018","1 March 2018 through 3 March 2018","Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu","143196","","978-153863701-2","","","English","Proc.

These resources are freely available and environmentally friendly. For isolated areas where grid infrastructure is not possible, integration of these resources is economically and technically advantageous. The current article describe the integration of different renewable energy resources for a group of villages of India state of Uttarakhand. The integrated model consists of available energy resources in the vicinity such as Micro-hydro power (MHP), Biomass energy system (BES), Solar photovoltaic system (SPV) and Wind energy system (WES) in order to fulfill the total energy demand of the area. To know the utilization of different renewable energy resource a factor introduced which is known as utilization factor. The value of utilization calculated by using different optimization methods (Fmincon, GA, hybrid) for a microgrid model. Comparative analysis of different optimization technique suggest that results obtained using hybrid optimization technique is better than GA and Fmincon. Further, the feasibility study of developed microgrid model is investigated by introducing a factor optimum power delivery factor (OPDF). This factor varies from 1.0 to 0.25 considering the intermittency of available renewable resources. Studies suggest that OPDF in the range of 1.0-0.75 provide feasible solution of energy demand and beyond this it is infeasible. © 2019 IEEE.","cost of energy; electrification; optimization; planning; rural grid; sizing","Electric power transmission; Energy management; Microgrids; Photovoltaic cells; Planning; Rural areas; Solar power generation; Wind power; Biomass energy systems; Comparative analysis; Electrical generation; Grid infrastructures; Hybrid optimization; Optimization techniques; Renewable energy systems; Solar photovoltaic system; Resource allocation","","","","","","","Robert F.C., Gopalan S., Low cost, highly reliable rural electri fi cation through a combination of grid extension and local renewable energy generation, Sustain.

In front of the growing demand for electricity principally for the remote and isolated areas, photovoltaic systems, especially water pumping systems, begin to find great applications. Unfortunately, these systems have faced a number of problems even nowadays: a problem of maintenance and repair. Augmented Reality (short: AR) seems to be a powerful promising technology that can answer to the problem related to the maintenance of photovoltaic pumping systems The introduction of e-maintenance can reduce cost and provide fast and easy access to relevant information for the worker by freeing distance constraints. In this paper, a distributed e-maintenance platform based on AR benefits for photovoltaic pumping system is proposed. The distributed aspect of this system will allow the remote collaboration between a remote expert and a worker. Two main aspects are studied and developed. The first aspect addresses a new collaboration strategy based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). The second aspect ensures the virtual objects transfer from the remote expert in real time. Experimental results are conducted in a first time in a mini solar station to show the feasibility of the approach. © 2015 IEEE.","Augmented Reality; E-Maintenance platform; renewable energy; web services","Augmented reality; Information services; Photovoltaic cells; Pumping plants; Pumps; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Web services; Distance constraints; E maintenance; Photovoltaic power systems; Photovoltaic pumping system; Photovoltaic systems; Renewable energies; Use of renewable energies; Water pumping systems; Maintenance","","","","","","","Chebel-Morello B., Medjahera K., Hadj Arabb A., Bandoub F., Bouchaibb S., Zerhouni N., E-Maintenance for photovoltaic power generation system, Energy Procedia, 18, pp. 640-643, (2012); Bouzidi B., Haddadi M., Belmokhtar O., Assessment of a photovoltaic pumping system in the areas of the Algerian Sahara, Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 13, pp. 879-886, (2009); Meah K., Fletcher S., Ula S., Solar photovoltaic water pumping for remote locations, Renew Sustain Energy Rev, Elsevier, 12, pp. 472-487, (2008); Glasnovic Z., Djurin B., Margeta J., PV power for urban water supply, Int.

So the interest on clean energy is increasing tremendously. In Bangladesh power crisis is a regular and acute problem. There are many isolated areas and islands where no electricity have been reached yet. To abate the severe energy problem wind and solar energy has good prospects. Bangladesh is situated between 20.30 and 26.38 degrees north latitude and 88.04 and 92.44 degrees east which is an ideal location for solar energy utilization and It's long costal line is suitable for wind energy as it is caused because of the bumpy heating of the atmosphere by the sun and revolving earth. In this paper, we have proposed a Hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) based on Wind turbine and PV module which is capable of meeting 50% of Sandwip's load. We checked the possibility of meeting this demand by simulating this system by creating a prototypical in HOMER simulation software. © 2014 IEEE.","HOMER; Hybrid renewable energy system (HRES); Solar Energy; Wind Energy","Climate change; Computer software; Earth atmosphere; Energy utilization; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Wind power; Clean energy; Energy problem; HOMER; Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES); Hybrid renewable energy systems; North latitudes; PV modules; Simulation software; Energy policy","","","","","","","Alam M.H., Manfred D., Hybrid systems for decentralized power generation in Bangladesh, Center for Development Research (ZEF), (2009); Ministry of power, Energy and Mineral Resources, (2008); Bajpai P., Prakshan N.P., Kishore N.K., Renewable hybrid stand-alone telecom power system modeling and analysis, IEE, TENCON, (2009); Dalton G.J., Lockington D.A., Baldock T.E., Feasibility analysis of stand-alone renewable energy supply options for large hotel, Renewable Energy, 33, pp. 1475-1490, (2008); Islam M.R., Beg M.R.A., Renewable energy resources and technologies practice in Bangladesh, Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 12, pp. 299-343, (2008); Nandi S.K., Ghosh H.R., A wind-PV-battery hybrid power system at Sitakunda in Bangladesh, Energy Policy, 37, pp. 3659-3664, (2009); Mukut, Islam M.Q., Alam M.M., Et al., Analysis of wind characteristics in Costal Areas of Bangladesh, Journal of Mechanical Engineering, 39, pp. 45-49, (2008); Sadrul Islam A.K.M., Islam M., Rahman T., Effective renewable energy activities in Bangladesh, Renewable Energy, 31, 5, pp. 677-688, (2006); Sarkar M.A.R., Ehsan M., Islam M.A., Issues relating to energy conservation and renewable energy in Bangladesh, Energy for Sustainable Development, 7, 2, pp. 77-87, (2003)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2014 2nd International Conference on Green Energy and Technology, ICGET 2014","5 September 2014 through 6 September 2014","Dhaka","109491","","978-147996640-0","","","English","Int.

The role of the Satcom in 5G and in the internet of things is beyond the classical satellite usages and customers. The Satcom plays a key role by extending the coverage of the terrestrial networks, providing connection for maritime, aircrafts and isolated areas; relieving the traffic congestion and providing added resilience for critical applications. The revolution in the satellite communication industry has become evident in the past few years. We are witnessing a raise of new constellations such as O3B or OneWeb, the renovation of the Iridium fleet, etc. Meanwhile in the ground segment, manufacturers of equipments are competing to deliver more efficient modulations supported by cheaper, smaller and easier to deploy units. If we look at the geostationary orbit, the satellites operators are struggling to offer higher throughput and improved adaptive solutions to reduce the cost per bit. In addition, the innovations in satellite platforms with more precise AOCS, and more capacity of batteries and solar cells, 3D printout circuits and also with the massive production of small satellites using assembly-line-based manufacturing processes such as OneWeb and the availability of new commercial launchers will definitively and completely change the commercial space industry. Many solutions have been tested in the past few years to enhance flexibility of the satellite communications, in particular in the traditional geostationary orbit. A flexible payload can be reconfigured in several ways as for example by modifying the coverage areas, each transponder power or the frequency and bandwidth of each channel, being the recent Quantum satellite (an ESA’s ARTES program) a good example. A payload that fulfils the three adaptive capacities (coverage, channel power and channel frequency plus bandwidth) shall allow the satellites operators to completely redefine the mission once in orbit either to adapt it to a changing demand or in case of moving the satellite to a different orbital slot. In classical missions the payload requirements are already almost fixed a few years before the launch and remains fixed during 15 years or even more while in-orbit. The payload is designed to provide the specified service in a designated area and therefore the main tasks of the satellite operators, as far as the payload operations are concerned, consist in dealing with interferences sources, meteorology events and satellite components aging, solar panels and TWTAs, which shall require eventually increasing/decreasing the operational point of the transponders or switching to a spare unit in case of failure of a nominal one and, if the payload support this, changing the uplink to downlink connectivity. Flexible payloads include the dynamic modification in the transmission plan in response to users changing demands as a new variable in regular operations, which shall have a great impact in the way payload operations need to be handled driving the need of automation with support for managing the interactions among the payload subsystems. Another concept that changes completely from fixed missions to flexible ones is the spare unit management. This, being a basic concept when designing, building and operating the fixed payload, fades away in the flexible payloads where no units are designed as spare equipment. This paper focus on the changes in payload operation concepts from traditional geostationary missions to flexible payload ones and the ground systems required to efficiently operate a flexible payload maximizing the provided capacity. Main requirements for an in-flight mission design, link budget and payload management tool are exposed, and finally, GMV smart payload suite is introduced as a possible solution focusing on how to fulfil the presented requirements and a possible evolution of the suite for carrier monitoring using the capabilities of a flexible payload. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The residents can utilize the locally available energy resources for fulfilling their need for electricity. The availability of electricity in the darkness of night facilitates higher productivity. In this paper, design of a solar PV-diesel mini-grid system has been presented for a locality in Char Parbotipur (25.75°N 89.66°E). This island is situated 20 km north-east from Kurigram district, Bangladesh and surrounded by Brahmaputra river and Dudhkumar river, far from the national grid. Very few residents use stand-alone Solar Home Systems (SHS) and diesel generators. Diesel generators have environmental concern which can be minimized by using hybrid renewable energy systems. This paper aims at designing an optimal energy system consisting solar PV having diesel generator for fulfilling the load demand. The proposed energy system can generate electricity at a cost of $0.461/kWh for a load of 115 kWh/day. Sensitivity analysis is presented to understand the effect of diesel price and solar irradiation on the cost of electricity and net present cost of the system. Comparison between the proposed hybrid renewable energy system and an energy system comprising diesel generator only are also presented to understand the effect of solar PV integration with diesel generators for environmental benefits. The solar PV-diesel energy system emits 53.68% lower CO2 as compared to diesel generator.","Diesel generator; HOMER; Mini-grid; Renewable energy; Solar energy","","","","","","","","Annual Report. 2013-2014; Zubair A., Tanvir A.A., Hasan M.M., Optimal Planning of Standalone Solar-Wind-Diesel Hybrid Energy System for a Coastal Area of Bangladesh, International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2, 6, pp. 731-738, (2012); Islam A.K.M.S., Rahman M.M., Mondal M.A.H., Alam F., Hybrid energy system for St. Martin Island, Bangladesh: An optimized model, Procedia Engineering, 49, pp. 179-188, (2012); Mondal M.A.H., Islam A.K.M.S., Potential and viability of grid-connected solar PV system in Bangladesh, Renewable Energy, 36, 6, pp. 1869-1874, (2011); Mondal M.A.H., Islam A.K.M.S., Technoeconomic feasibility of grid connected solar PV system in Bangladesh, 1st International Conference on the Developments in Renewable Energy Technology (ICDRET), pp. 1-4, (2009); Ngan M.S., Tan C.W., Assessment of economic viability for PV/wind/diesel hybrid energy system in southern Peninsular Malaysia, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 16, 1, pp. 634-664, (2012); Chandel M., Agarwal G.D., Mathur S., Mathur A., Techno-economic analysis of solar photovoltaic power plant for garment zone of Jaipur city, Case Studies in Thermal Engineering, 2, pp. 1-7, (2014); Rohani G., Nour M., Techno-economical analysis of stand-alone hybrid renewable power system for Ras Musherib in United Arab Emirates, Energy, 64, 1, pp. 828-841, (2013); Fleck B., Hout M., Comparative life-cycle assessment of a small wind turbine for residential off-grid use, Renewable Energy, 34, 12, pp. 2688-2696, (2009); Li C., Ge X., Zheng Y., Xu C., Ren Y., Song C., Yan C., Techno-economic feasibility study of autonomous hybrid wind/PV/battery power system for a household in Urumqi, China, Energy, 55, pp. 263-272, (2013); Rehman S., Al-Hadhrami L.M., Study of a solar PV-diesel-battery hybrid power system for a remotely located population near Rafha, Saudi Arabia, Energy, 35, pp. 4986-4995, (2010); Adaramola M.S., Agelin-Chaab M., Paul S.S., Analysis of hybrid energy systems for application in southern Ghana, Energy Conversion and Management, 88, pp. 284-295, (2014); Sen R., Bhattacharyya S.C., Off-grid electricity generation with renewable energy technologies in India: An application of HOMER, Renewable Energy, 62, pp. 388-398, (2014); Fadaeenejad M., Radzi M.A.M., AbKadir M.Z.A., Hizam H., Assessment of hybrid renewable power sources for rural electrification in Malaysia, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 30, pp. 299-305, (2014); Ghasemi A., Asrari A., Zarif M., Abdelwahed S., Techno-economic analysis of stand-alone hybrid photovoltaic-diesel-battery systems for rural electrification in eastern part of Iran-A step toward sustainable rural development, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 28, pp. 456-462, (2013); Kusakana K., Vermaak H.J., Hybrid renewable power systems for mobile telephony base stations in developing countries, Renewable Energy, 51, pp. 419-425, (2013); Dalton G.J., Lockington D.A., Baldock T.E., Feasibility analysis of stand-alone renewable energy supply options for a large hotel, Renewable Energy, 33, pp. 1475-1490, (2008); Lambert T., Gilman P., Lilienthal P., Micropower system modeling with HOMER, Integration of Alternative Sources of Energy, (2005); Hoque M., Bhuiyan I.K.A., Ahmed R., Farooque A.A., Aditya S.K., Design, Analysis and Performance Study of a Hybrid PVDiesel-Wind System for a Village Gopal Nagar in Comilla, Global Journal of Science Frontier Research, 12, 5, (2012); Mondal A.H., Denich M., Hybrid systems for decentralized power generation in Bangladesh, Energy for Sustainable Development, 14, 1, pp. 48-55, (2010)","S.

In islands, power generation is mainly done with diesel generators, but the high costs and energy spent on transporting fuel and the CO2 emissions generated from its operation have been raising concerns lately. In this study, a hydrogen fueled micro-grid using solar photovoltaics and heat collectors is proposed for power generation in isolated areas. The grid consists of a central facility with a main power generation system, connected to a number of residences. An optimization model is built which finds the size and component capacities of the micro-grid at which hydrogen consumption per household is minimized. The model is run using energy demands and irradiation data from the areas of Kansai and Kyushu, Japan. The model was able to find the trends at which hydrogen consumption can be minimized. Primary energy consumption by the grid showed high savings compared to the conventional system. Potential sources of hydrogen fuel for the proposed grid are discussed as well.","Energy sustainability; Hydrogen fuel; Isolated area; Micro-grid; Optimization; Solar energy","Energy utilization; Fuels;

Bangladesh is a small country in South Asia with a huge population. The country has many isolated areas that are not connected to the national grid. People living in those off-grid areas mainly use diesel generators that emit GHGs into the atmosphere contributing to global warming. Electricity production using solar energy can be an attractive alternative from economic and environmental perspective. The present study attempts to conduct a techno-economic assessment by developing a bottom-up data-intensive spread-sheet-based model. The model estimates the unit cost of electricity generated by a 3.40 kWp stand-alone solar photovoltaic system (PV) for an isolated locality in Char Godagari, Rajshahi. The island has geographical coordinates of 24°28'6""N and 88°19'25""E and is situated in Rajshahi district. The unit cost of electricity by solar energy was found to be $0.72/kWh or 55.47 Bangladeshi Taka (BDT)/kWh with a net present cost of $12,027.83 or BDT 926,142.55 for the selected location, Char Godagari. The results show that battery is the most expensive component of the solar PV system. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to see the impact of various input parameters on the unit cost of electricity.","Cost of electricity; Electricity generation; Renewable energy; Solar photovoltaic;

This is true for areas that receive high averages of solar radiation annually. Using microturbine as a standby source will make utilization of hybrid systems more attractive. A sizing optimization of the hybrid system components, an economic feasibility study and a complete design of the hybrid system consisting of photovoltaic (PV) panels, a microturbine as a backup power source and a battery system supplying a small community in a tropical climate area were presented in this paper. A scenario depending on PV standalone and another scenario depending on microturbine alone were also studied and analyzed in this paper. This is to select the most appropriate considering cost and pollutant emissions for these areas. A simulation program depending on an iterative approach was used to optimize the sizes of PV system and battery bank. Specifications of the hybrid system components are then determined according to the optimized values. Solar radiation data is firstly analyzed and the tilted angle of the PV panels is also optimized. It is found that electrifying rural small community using this hybrid system is very beneficial and competitive with other types of conventional sources as it decreases both operating costs and pollutant emissions. © 2013 IEEE.","Economics; Hybrid system; Microturbine; Optimization; Photovoltaic","Economic analysis; Economics; Energy conversion; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Pollution; Solar radiation; Sun; Turbines; Economic feasibilities; Iterative approach; Micro turbine; Photovoltaic; Photovoltaic panels; Pollutant emission; Sizing optimization; Solar radiation data; Hybrid systems","","","","","","","Bhandari R., Stadler I., Electrification using solar photovoltaic systems in nepal, Applied Energy, 88, pp. 458-465, (2011); Kamalapur G.D., Udaykumar R.Y., Rural electrification in india and feasibility of photovoltaic solar home systems, International Journal of Electrical Power &Amp; Energy Systems, 33, pp. 594-599, (2011); Daud A., Ismail M.S., Design of isolated hybrid systems minimizing costs and pollutant emissions, Renewable Energy, 44, pp. 215-224, (2012); Senjyu T., Et al., Optimum configuration for renewable generating systems in residence using genetic algorithm, IEEE TRANSACTIONS on ENERGY CONVERSIon, 21, pp. 459-466, (2006); Hong Y.-Y., Lian R.-C., Optimal sizing of hybridwind/pvldiesel generation in a stand-alone power system using markov-based genetic algorithm, IEEE TRANSACTIONS on POWER DELIVERY, 27, pp. 640-647, (2012); Lee D.-J., Wang L., Small-signal stability analysis of an autonomous hybrid renewable energy power generation/energy storage system part i:Time-domain simulations, IEEE TRANSACTIONS on ENERGY CONVERSIon, 23, pp. 311-320, (2008); Ismail M.S., Et al., Techno-economic analysis of an optimized photovoltaic and diesel generator hybrid power system for remote houses in a tropical climate, Energy Conversion &Management, 69, pp. 163-173, (2013); Twaha S., Et al., Applying grid-connected photovoltaic system as alternative source of electricity to supplement hydro power instead of using diesel in uganda, Energy, 37, pp. 185-194, (2012); Pourmousavi S.A., Et al., Real-time energy management of a stand-alone hybrid windmicroturbine energy system using particle swarm optimization, IEEE TRANSACTIONS on SUSTAINABLE ENERGY, 1, pp. 193-201, (2010); Alsayed M., Et al., Multicriteria optimal sizing of photovoltaic-wind turbine grid connected systems, IEEE TRANSACTIONS on ENERGY CONVERSIon, 28, pp. 370-379, (2013); Nehrir M.H., Et al., A review of hybrid renewablel alternative energy systems for electric power generation:Configurations, control, and applications, IEEE TRANSACTIONS on SUSTAINABLE ENERGY, 2, pp. 392-403, (2011); Khatib T., Et al., Optimal sizing of building integrated hybrid pV/diesel generator system for zero load rejection for malaysia, Energy and Buildings, 43, pp. 3430-3435, (2011); Rajkumar R.K., Et al., Techno-economical optimization of hybrid pv/wind/battery system using neuro-Fuzzy, Energy, 36, pp. 5148-5153, (2011); Haidar A.M.H., Et al., Optimal configuration assessment of renewable energy in malaysia, Renewable Energy, 36, (2011); Caisheng W., Et al., Power management of a standalone hybrid wind-microturbine distributed generation system, Power Electronics and Machines in Wind Applications, 2009.

Communities organize in isolated cabins dispersed in an extensive area surrounding the community center. The harsh natural environment and poor living conditions affect people's health and increase child mortality, especially in winter. Daytime solar radiation is of high intensity. At night exterior temperatures are-10 C, while indoor temperatures of cabins barely reach 0 C. This research sought to improve the thermal performance of these cabins with passive design strategies and local resources. The methodology included: a) collection of weather data versus indoor thermal performance, availability of local resources and understanding domestic organization patterns; b) definition of comfort temperature range and analysis of local materials; c) technology transfer by involving the population in the construction of a prototype. Simple passive strategies of air tightness and solar gain with local available materials (adobe for walls, totora reed (Schoenoplectus tatora) and sheep wool for insulation, and stone and wood to waterproof the floor) improved night thermal performance in these isolated areas. Although local people are starting to implement these techniques in their own cabins, this is just the starting point towards appropriate thermal comfort. © Copyright 2017 NCEUB.","Passive solar design; Thermal performance; Totora insulation; Tropical high altitude climate; Vernacular architecture","Population statistics; Sea level; Technology transfer; Altitude regions; Comfort temperatures; Community centers; Indoor temperature; Living conditions; Natural environments; Passive design strategies; Thermal Performance; Thermal insulation","","","","","CONCYTEC National Council for Science and Technology; Research Centre of Architecture; City, University of London; Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, CIAC; Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, PUCP; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red-Fisiopatología de la Obesidad y Nutrición, CIBEROBN","This research was possible thanks to the funding and support of CONCYTEC National Council for Science and Technology, the Research Centre of Architecture and the City (CIAC – “Centro de Investigación de la Arquitectura y la Ciudad”) and “Grupo Centro Tierra”, both of the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Peru.

Clean and renewable production systems is gaining incentive to search for pieces of institutions and the government, especially the sources like the sun and the wind. There are plenty of both sources throughout the Brazilian territory and its use becomes interesting to isolated regions due to lack of network installation that enables access to electricity. This study investigates the production of energy from a hybrid system composed of photovoltaic panels and a wind turbine. These systems are adequate to meet the energy needs of isolated areas due to the high cost of electrification places with low demand and difficult to access. The project was developed at the Center of Alternative Energy and Renewable-NEAR Rural Energizing Laboratory of the Department of UNESP Rural Engineering, Faculty Agricultural Sciences, Lageado Experimental Farm, located in Botucatu, São Paulo, Brazil, which was used three photovoltaic I-100 Isofoton with nominal power of 100Wp each, for a total installed 300Wp and a wind turbine AIR X-rural model SOUTHWEST WINDPOWER with nominal power of 400 W, which was obtained for a year energy production data using this system.

Based on these problems, it is cleared that an electricity system is required for long-term solutions so that it can enhance the role of new and renewable energy, improve the electricity reliability and reduce the energy costs. Efficiency and effectiveness is expected to increase the sustainable electricity supply for remote and isolated area in Madura island by utilizing the available resources like potential solar energy as a new and renewable energy. The development of photovoltaic power plant is a fast and independent solution because the access and infrastructure in Madura island doesn't support yet for the conventional electrical facilities. System dynamics method is used to analyse the system by creating a scenario model to identify any factors and variables which affect the system. As the result of the scenario model, total demand for electricity supply in the 58 remote villages in Pamekasan is 24,935 MW, which cost Rp 632.812.500.000,- for the photovoltaic power plant investment.

Solar PV is one of the most widely used renewable energy resources. The output of a panel is highest when the incident ray is perpendicular to the panel plane. Due to variations in the locus of the sun over the year, the alignment of the panel should be changed according to the sun position for maximum generation. However, changing the tilt angle needs single axis tracker or double axes tracker which is costly and also needs maintenance; thus may not be suitable. Therefore, the panel is kept at the average tilt of year at which the ray is perpendicular for the maximum time. This may be termed as the default tilt angle. The generation of solar panel varies over the year providing maximum generation at the default tilt angle. Similarly, the consumption of an area is also varies over the year. The amount of generation may not proportional as the demand, thus it results surplus or shortage. For an isolated area, it is hardly possible to use surplus energy considering certain demand profile. Even, it is not possible to store the surplus energy of a season to any device for long time to use it for another season. However, the surplus energy of a season may be shifted to the shortage season by changing the tilt angle. Different tilt angle will provide different pattern of generation over the year. The generation at optimum tilt angle will not maximize the generation of energy over the year rather it will maximize the demand met by shifting the energy to shortage season from surplus season. A new concept to maximize the energy usage from solar PV by changing the tilt angle and thus minimize the shortage to meet the demand of an isolated power system is also introduced here. © 2015 IEEE.","load management; micro-grid; optimization; penetration; renewable energy; Tilt angle","Electric load management; Energy resources; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Isolated power system; Micro grid; Optimum tilt angles; penetration; Renewable energies; Single-axis trackers; Solar PV panels; Tilt angle; Renewable energy resources","","","","","","","Armstrong S., Hurley W.G., A new methodology to optimise solar energy extraction under cloudy conditions, Journal Homepage; Zhao Q., Wang P., Goel L., Optimal PV panel tilt angle based on solar radiation prediction, Probabilistic Methods Applied to Power Systems (PMAPS), 2010 IEEE 11th International Conference on, pp. 425-430; Khatib T., Mohamed A., Sopian K., On the monthly optimum tilt angle of solar panel for five sites in Malaysia, Power Engineering and Optimization Conference (PEDCO) Melaka, Malaysia 2012 IEEE International; Chang Y.P., Wang D., Optimization of tilt angle for photovoltaic modules based on the neural-genetic algorithm, Journal of Nan Kai, 7, 1, pp. 57-70, (2010); Khan B.H., Non-Conventional Energy Resources, (2009); Monthly Operational Report 2011-2013; Annual Report 2012-2013; Islam A., Islam M.S., Hasan M.M., Khan A.H., Analysis of wind characteristics and wind energy potential in coastal Area of Bangladesh: Case Study-Cox's Bazar, Elektrika, 15, 2, pp. 1-10, (2014); Performance analysis of a solar water heater, Smart Grid & Renewable Energy, 2, 4, pp. 396-398, (2011)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","First Security Islami Bank Ltd.

This paper presents a design methodology and economical evaluation to implement a hybrid power system composed of a photovoltaic power plant, electrical storage and a backup system of diesel generators in an isolated village in Uganda named Ntoroko. Results show that the usage of battery storage is economically crucial, particularly in areas with a low daily electrical consumption and peak loads increasing in the early morning and late evening when the solar radiation is lower and PV array has a reduced power production. Results disclose that the optimal configuration of the hybrid system (PV-storage-diesel generators), despite its high investment cost, presents an economic benefit of 25.5 and 22.2% compared to the usage of only PV array and diesel generators and only diesel generators and a reduction of fuel consumption equal to 74.7 and 77%, respectively. © 2017 The Authors.","Electric storage; Hybrid systems; Off-grid; Optimization; Photovoltaic systems; Solar radiation","Carbon dioxide; Design; Developing countries; Electric power generation; Fuel storage; Hybrid systems; Investments; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Rural areas; Solar power generation; Solar radiation; Design Methodology; Economical evaluation; Electrical consumption; Hybrid power systems; Off-grids; Photovoltaic power plant; Photovoltaic systems; Rural electrification; Electric power transmission networks","","","","","","","Technical Report, International Energy Agency, (2014); Adaramola M.S., Paul S.S., Oyewola O.M., Assesment of decentralized hybrid pv-solar-diesel power system for applications in northen part of Nigeria, Energy for Sustainable Development, 19, pp. 72-82, (2014); Ngan M.S., Tan C.W., Assesment for economic viability for pv/wind/diesel hybrid energy systemin southern peninsular Malaysia, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviwers, 16, pp. 634-647, (2012); Rehman S., Al-Hadhrami L.M., Study of a solar pv-diesel-battery hybrid power system for a remotely located population near Rafha, Saudi Arabia, Energy, 35, pp. 4986-4995, (2010); Agarwal N., Kumar A.V., Optimization of grid independent hybrid pvdieselbattery system for power generation in emote villages of Uttar Pradesh, India, Energy for Sustainable Development, 17, pp. 210-219, (2013); Kemausuor F., Adkins E., Adu-Poku I., Brew-Hammond A., Modi V., Electrification planning using network planner tool: The case of Ghana, Energy for Sustainable Development, 19, pp. 92-101, (2014); Comodi G., Renzi M., Cioccolanti L., Caresana F., Pelagalli L., Hybrid system with micro gas turbine and PV (photovoltaic) plant: Guidelines for sizing and management strategies, Energy, 89, pp. 226-235, (2015); Caresana F., Pelagalli L., Comodi G., Renzi M., Microturbogas cogeneration systems for distributed generation: Effects of ambient temperature on global performance and components' behavior, Applied Energy, 124, pp. 17-27, (2014)","G.

Electrical energy sources such as solar, hydro, and wind are energy that can be developed to be alternative energy sources in remote areas, especially in rural areas. Photovoltaic (PV) is one source of energy that can be used to supply energy needs in rural areas. PV has the maximum point of power affected by temperature and irradiance values. To get the maximum power, Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) is used. Generally, MPPT is only aimed to get PV maximum power value. However, in a mini grid system, the system can possibly need only a part of the power generated by PV, not all energy produced by PV. If PV still generates at the maximum power at a full battery condition, the over voltage may occur. Therefore, PV in the mini grid should be controlled by a PI-based fuzzy controller to manage the PV power generation. The proposed controller suppresses PV power output when there is excess power in the system. The system design is started by composing formulated load models based on survey data. It will be continued by determining the optimum PV value and battery storage capacity. Then, a PI-based fuzzy controller for the modified MPPT control is designed to control power produced by PV. Battery SOC, PV voltage and PV output current are used as fuzzy inputs. The results show that the proposed controller has better performance with no overshoot and fast response time compared to a conventional fuzzy MPPT. © 2017 IEEE.","DC Mini Grid; Demand; Fuzzy; MPPT; PV","Battery storage; Controllers; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Electric power transmission networks; Maximum power point trackers; Power control; Rural areas; Secondary batteries; Temperature control; Alternative energy source; Demand; Electrical energy sources; Electrical energy supply; Fuzzy; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Mini grids; PV power generation; Electric power system control","","","","","","","Wunder B., Ott L., Kaiser J., Han Y., Fersterra F., Marz M., Overview of different topologies and control strategies for DC micro grids, 2015 IEEE 1st Int.

This algorithm is inspired by the frequency separation method. Indeed, it is based on the calculation of sliding averages using centered moving average filters, which allow simultaneous and natural processing of measurement data (past) and load and sunshine forecast (future). Moreover, this algorithm has no limits of degrees of freedom and can handle more than two sources of energy without resorting to complex problems. The algorithm is tested on a hybrid system composed of solar panels as a renewable energy source, a fuel cell as a secondary source, a battery bank and a supercapacitor bank as energy storage systems. The main aim of the proposed strategy is to minimize the total operating cost of the system while satisfying the constraints required by the energy storage systems. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed method is highly improved through the addition of an automatic correction process. The simulation results are convincing and validate the proposed energy management strategy. © 2018 IEEE.","Degrees of freedom; Energy management; Moving average; Power forecasting","Bandpass filters; Data handling; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Digital storage; Energy management; Energy storage; Forecasting; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Hybrid systems; Renewable energy resources; Automatic corrections; Electric energy management; Energy management strategies; Energy storage systems; Moving average filter; Moving averages; Power forecasting; Renewable energy source; Energy management systems","","","","","","","Dufo-Lopez R., Fernandez-Jimenez L.A., Ramirez-Rosado I.J., Artal-Sevil J.S., Dominguez-Navarro J.A., Bernal-Agustin J.L., Daily operation optimisation of hybrid stand-alone system by model predictive control considering ageing model, Energy Convers.

The prototype was designed for application in remote or isolated areas in Indonesia. The fermentation system, which was designed to be as simple as possible, includes the preparation of the microbial seed, the substrate material, the vessel and other required equipment, gas capture and purification, a converter, and transportation. The model experiment in the field undergoes several modifications depending on the biomass sources in the actual location, i.e., some areas have agroforestry, sugarcane, soy sauce and palm sugar wastes. The light intensity and temperature followed the natural conditions. The results indicated that a cultivation scale of 5-25 L per substrate does not affect the result, i.e., a hydrogen production of approximately 60-70% of the total gas produced. The hydrogen gas produced was converted into electricity sources to power fans and house lamps. However, the hydrogen power is not yet sustainable due to the batch fermentation system, the biomass supply and the local electrical system, which is conventional (not a grid system). We propose to merge the electrical system in those areas, i.e., combining the source of electrical power from wind, solar, biomass, ocean current and fossil fuel-based generators. The model of the electricity pool system is important for Indonesia because, geographically, Indonesia consists of more than seventeen thousand islands, where the electricity supply remains unstable. © 2014 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Solar energy is an effective solution to extend the use of these intelligent systems in isolated areas. In fact, this paper presents a practical solution based on the power-aware design for controlling the indoor environment of solar greenhouses. The system consists of feedback fuzzy logic controllers that log key field parameters using specific sensors and performs control actions for the environmental temperature, soil moisture, and relative humidity. With regard to the battery-coupled architecture of the solar system, the decision level is designed to consider the availability of operational resources before acting. Keeping in mind the constraint of low-cost, we propose a flexible design of an embedded system able to support remote management of the indoor environment key-parameters. The proposed control system was validated experimentally. The efficiency of the system was assessed by demonstrating significant energy and water savings as well as protection of solar system components from dry running issues. © 2019 The Authors.","embedded system; fuzzy logic; multithreading; power-aware design; real-time; solar greenhouse","Computer circuits; Control systems; Embedded systems; Greenhouses; Humidity control; Intelligent computing; Intelligent systems; Power management; Soil moisture; Solar energy; Solar heating; Solar system; Thermal logging; Water resources; Environmental temperature; Fuzzy logic control; Fuzzy logic controllers; Multi-threading; Power-aware design; Practical solutions; Real time; Solar greenhouse; Fuzzy logic","","","","","Moulay Ismaïl University","We would like to thank Moulay Ismaïl University for financial support of the project “Research support”.","Nicolosi V., Messineo, An innovative adaptive control system to regulate microclimatic conditions in a greenhouse, Energies, 10, 5, (2017); Stambouli F., Zapata, Water and energy management in an automated irrigation district, Agricultural Water Management, 42, pp. 66-76, (2014); Nikolidakis K., Vergados, Douligeris, Energy efficient automated control of irrigation in agriculture by using wireless sensor networks, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 113, pp. 154-163, (2015); Vassilyev K., Kudinov, Pashchenko, Intelligent control systems, Procedia Computer Science, 103, C, pp. 623-628, (2017); Tamilselvan, Aarthy, Online tuning of fuzzy logic controller using Kalman algorithm for conical tank system, Journal of Applied Research and Technology, (2017); Iliev S., Zakeri, A fuzzy logic-based controller for integrated control of protected cultivation, Management of Environmental Quality: An International Journal, 25, 1, pp. 75-85, (2014); Azaza E., Fabrizio I., Mami, An intelligent system for the climate control and energy savings in agricultural greenhouses, Energy Efficiency, 9, 6, pp. 1241-1255, (2016); Rahangadale, Choudhary, On fuzzy logic based model for irrigation controller using Penman-Monteith equation, IJCA Proceedings on 2nd National Conference on Information and Communication Technology (NCICT), pp. 22-25, (2011); Ji Q., Huo, Design of fuzzy control algorithm for precious irrigation system in greenhouse, Comput.

This sophisticated, interconnected distribution system addresses the need for application in locations with electric supply and/or delivery constraints, in isolated areas, and for protection of critical loads and economically sensitive improvement. The major problem occurred in micro-grid protection related to large difference between utility grid and micro-grid mode fault currents.

The solar photovoltaic energy production have a great potential in sunny regions. An adequate energy scheduling should guarantee the priority loads functioning face to climate instability. In this paper, a Timed Hybrid Petri Nets (THPNs) tool is proposed to model the behavior of a standalone PV/Batteries system established in an isolated chalet. Through this model, an energy scheduling algorithm is developed to satisfy the loads demand and to make maximum use of generated photovoltaic energy compared to stored energy. Based on a predefined classification of priority and secondary loads, the developed algorithm can make decision on operation times of loads.

The residual pressure head at the receiving reservoir is then dissipated through control valves (mechanically or hydraulically actuated), sometimes augmented by orifice plates where there is a propensity for cavitation. There are possibilities to add turbines in parallel and generate hydroelectricity at these locations using the flow and head available. The benefit of this hydropower generating application is that minimal civil works need to be done, as the control valves are normally inside a control room/valve chamber. No negative environmental or social effects require mitigation, and the anticipated lead times should be short. From a topographical perspective the City of Tshwane has a lower elevation than the bulk service reservoirs of Rand Water, which is the main water supply. Water is distributed through a large water system that includes 160 reservoirs, 42 water towers, 10 677 km of pipes and more than 260 pressure reducing stations (PRS) that operate at pressures of up to 250 m. The top ten hydropower potential sites in the City of Tshwane water distribution network have a total energy generating capacity of approximately 10 000 MWh/a. A number of potential conduit-hydropower sites have shown promise of short payback periods. The identifying and development of these sites in Tshwane to convert water pressure to electricity is ongoing and exploited further. Various challenges currently exist with reservoir communication in isolated areas due to vandalism and theft of necessary infrastructure, including electricity cables and solar panels. Because conduit-hydropower systems can be housed completely inside chambers, vandalism and theft can be mitigated. Therefore, one of the major benefits of hydropower turbines at these sites is that the hydroelectric potential could be exploited to power telemetry, pressure management, flow control and monitoring/security systems. Alternatively or additionally, other local demand and/or (depending upon the quantum of energy available) off-site energy demand clusters, or even a municipal or national grid, could also be serviced by these power stations. The capacity of hydroelectric installations can vary to suit the application for the amount of power needed or to be generated. Short payback periods, especially when using pumps as turbines, also make conduit-hydropower systems attractive. © 2014, South African Institute of Civil Engineers.

These fossil fuels have finite reserves and will run out in the future. The negative effect of these fossil fuels is that they produce pollutant gases when they are burned in the process to generate electricity. Fossil fuels are a non-renewable energy source. However, renewable energy resources (solar, wind, hydro, biomass, geothermal and ocean) are constantly replaced, hence will not run out, and are usually less polluting. Due to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions more attention is being given to renewable energy. As wind is a renewable energy it is a clean and abundant resource that can produce electricity with virtually no pollutant gas emission. Induction generators are widely used for wind powered electric generation, especially in remote and isolated areas, because they do not need an external power supply to produce the excitation magnetic field. Furthermore, induction generators have more advantages such as cost, reduced maintenance, rugged and simple construction, brushless rotor (squirrel cage) and so on. This paper presents the detailed survey on performance of wind farms situated at Jamgodrani hills and Nagda hill, near Dewas city in Madhya Pradesh, India. Variation of various performance indices such as total yearly generation, total availability of grid, total availability of wind generator, total generating units per wind generator and capacity utilization factor is discussed for wind farm on Jamgodrani hills and Nagda hill respectively.Latter, it introduces a simple and direct formula based on complex impedance matrix method to calculate the minimum excitation capacitance (Cmin) and corresponding maximum frequency (fmax)required for successful voltage build up across the terminal of three phase dual winding induction generator when operating on 225kW rating, used as wind generator in wind farm and variation of minimum excitation capacitance as well as corresponding maximum frequency is also being plotted for various conditions of load and speed. © 2014 The Authors.","Matlab/ Simulin; Renewable energy; Self-excited induction generator (SEIG); Total harmonic distortion (THD); Wind energy","","","","","","","","Simoes M.G., Farret F.A., Renewable Energy Systems: Design and Analysis with Induction Generators, (2004); Boldea I., Variable Speed Generators, (2004); Bansal R.C., Bhatti T.S., Kothari D.P., A bibliographical survey on induction generators for application of non-conventional energy systems, IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion, 18, 3, pp. 433-439, (2003); Murthy S.S., Singh B.P., Nagamani C., Satyanarayna K.V.V., Studies on the use of conventional induction motors as self-excited induction generator, IEEE Transaction on Energy Conversion, 3, pp. 842-848, (1988); Harrington R.J., Bassiouny F.M.M., New approach to determine the critical capacitance for self-excited induction generator, IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion, 13, 3, pp. 244-249, (1998); Kumar S., Pradhan S., Narayan R., Excitation capacitance requirements of three phase self excited induction generator for wind mill application, IEEE International Conference on Energy Efficient Technologies for Sustainability, pp. 365-370, (2013); Mahato S.N., Sing S.P., Sharma M.P., Capacitors required for maximum power of a self-excited single-phase induction generator using a three-phase machine, IEEE Trans.

The study analyzes the process of identifying the appropriate size of a SIRES considering technical and economic factors. An optimization model proposed in the literature was modified, and a subsequent spatial-temporal analysis of the different variables was conducted. The model comprises locally available renewable energy resources, such as biomass, biogas, wind power, solar photovoltaic, and thermal power. Furthermore, it was used to determine the energy potential of each of the isolated areas, identifying those areas in which the SIRES could be implemented as a sustainable solution. The design simulates the cost of the initial investment and energy generation in the chosen areas. The study also includes the selection of different system components and the use of the general model to determine the optimal combination of energy subsystems for isolated areas with the aim of minimizing the cost of energy generations. Finally, an economic evaluation showed that the use of a SIRES based mainly on solar energy supported by biomass, biogas, and mini-wind power costs approximately three times less than extending the electricity grid network. © 2019 by the authors.","Off-grid electrification; Optimization model; Smart integrated renewable energy system","Biogas; Costs; Economic analysis; Electric power system economics; Electric power transmission networks; Investments; Optimization; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Wind power; Economic evaluations; Integrated renewable energy systems; Off-grid electrification; Optimal combination; Optimization modeling; Solar photovoltaics; Spatial temporal analysis; Sustainable solution; Smart power grids","","","","","","","Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, United Nations, (2019); Ramakumar R., Role of renewable energy in the development and electrification of remote and rural areas, IEEE Power Eng.

Recently, the integrated systems with two or more RES are being paid great attention for electrification of isolated areas and found to be an acceptable solution rather than uneconomical grid extension. In the present study, the integrated renewable energy system (IRES) model is developed using solar, wind, biomass and biogas energy sources to meet the electricity demand of the isolated rural community of Khatisitara village of Gujarat state in India. The operational strategy of IRES model is developed considering the distribution network losses as a system design parameter. The developed IRES model is optimized for minimum net present cost of the system using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm in MATLAB environment. The well-established genetic algorithm (GA) was used to validate the optimization results obtained from PSO. Further, the effects of distribution losses (DL) on the system sizing, reliability and economy have been evaluated. The sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effect of economically influencing parameters on the developed model. Finally, the break-even analysis was performed for the grid extension distance to examine the economic feasibility of IRES against grid extension. The simulation result shows that the impacts of DL on IRES reliability and economy are significant. Further analysis shows that the IRES using locally available renewable energy sources is a feasible option for rural electrification in considered study area rather than grid extension. © International Journal Of Renewable Energy Research, 2018.","Distribution loss; Economic feasibility; Grid extension; Integrated renewable energy system; Off-grid system","Electric utilities; Genetic algorithms; MATLAB; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Renewable energy resources; Rural areas; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable development; Electric power transmission networks; Particle size analysis; Distribution loss; Economic feasibilities; Economics analysis; Energy-system models; Grid extension; Integrated renewable energy systems; Off-grid system; Off-grids; Remote rural areas; Renewable energy source; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Power economies; Power reliability; Economic analysis","","","","","Alternate Hydro Energy Centre; All India Council for Technical Education, अभातशिप; Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, IITR; India Meteorological Department, IMD","Funding text 1: The authors gratefully acknowledge the research facilities provided by the Quality Improvement Program (QIP) centre and Alternate Hydro Energy Centre (AHEC), IIT Roorkee, India.

To satisfy this need we use solar energy which is available abundantly and indicate the same as source in the DC nanogrid which is used to supply power to an isolated area. As DC systems can be designed for specific loads. In this paper, we focus on increasing the efficiency of a DC nanogrid by reducing the switching losses. We achieved this by using a soft switching technique that is ZCS. The benefit of this technique are, the reduction in the size of the system and good results even at higher switching frequency. In ZCS, the current is forced to zero before the switch is turned off. These systems find application in isolated areas and grid applications. © 2017 IEEE.","converter; DC nanogrid; ZCS","Solar energy; Zero current switching; Alternative source; converter; DC nanogrid; Efficiency improvement; Grid applications; Soft-switching technique; Specific loads; Switching loss; Power control","","","","","","","Mackay L., Gebremedhin Hailu T., Chandra Mouli G., Ramirez-Elizondo L., Ferreira L.A., Bauer P., From DC Nanoand Microgrid S Toward S the Universal DC Distribution System-A Plea to Think Further into the Future, (2015); Zhiyuan Q., Energy Management Based on Multi-agent for Independent DC Micro-grid with Wind Solar Power, (2014); Mohitha Venkit S., Athira P.C., Solar Powered ZCS Bidirectional Buck-Boo St Converter Used in Battery Energy Storage Systems, (2016); Chung H.S.-H., Cheung W.-L., Tang K.S., A ZCS bidirecti onal Flyback DC/DC converter, IEEE, (2004)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2017 IEEE International Conference on Power, Control, Signals and Instrumentation Engineering, ICPCSI 2017","21 September 2017 through 22 September 2017","Chennai","137381","","978-153860813-5","","","English","IEEE Int.

Nano grids employing hybrid energy systems (HES) based on photovoltaics (PV) and wind farms are considered to be an effective option to electrify remote and isolated areas which are far from conventional grids. This is applicable to areas that receive high averages of solar radiation and sufficient average wind speed annually. In this research investigation, a DC nano-grid was modelled, simulated and optimized for a hybrid solar-PV and wind, with energy storage and a back-up diesel generator for Umzinyathi district in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. A site survey was conducted, wind resource and solar radiation data obtained for the purpose of load forecasting and system modelling. HOMER software was used for system modelling. Minimum cost optimization of the system was carried out taking into consideration the costs of system components, hourly solar radiation and rating parameters as inputs into the simulation program. Sensitivity variables were specified to examine the effect of their uncertainties on system performance. Based on simulation results, the optimal system comprises of a 100kW PV array, thirteen 7.5kW wind turbines, 20kW diesel generator, and 96 Trojan T-105 deep cycle batteries. The net present cost (NPC), cost of energy (CoE) and payback period of the optimal system were found to be 459 545, 0.248/kWh and 4 years respectively. The economic and environmental analysis indicated that it is more advisable to electrify remote settlements using a DC nano-grid based on hybrid systems with multiple renewable sources as they have lower operating costs and more environmental friendly due to the reduced dependence on diesel generating units. © 2016 IEEE.","Distribution Generation;

BP: 416, Tangier, Morocco","Solar and wind energy are considered as promising electrical generating sources. These renewable energies are omnipresent, with free access, and a friendly environmental impact. Their integration remains technically and economically advantageous for electrical generation in isolated areas (IS). In several cases, the separate use of solar and wind energy sources may result in considerable over-sizing, which makes the single renewable energy sources in implementation very costly. It is found that the use of one of the optimization sizing techniques could help to guarantee the maximum power reliability and the minimum system cost for the future hybrid implementation. Moreover, a remarkable interest is manifesting for the use of solar and wind renewable energy sources (RES), which provide a realistic form of electrical generation in isolated areas. This paper provides an updated literature review, of the most applied method and techniques used in sizing and optimization of PV-Wind based hybrid system (PWHS) for an isolated area aiming to reach the best compromise between power reliability and hybrid system costs. Furthermore, this work discusses a comparison of the most common topologies used for the implementation of PWHS, then, presents a mathematical model of the hybrid system components with an emphasis on the importance of power reliability and system cost, Finally, provides an extensive analysis of software tools and algorithm approach used in sizing optimization. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES);

Additionally, renewable energy sources can contribute significantly to the development of isolated areas that currently have no connection to the electricity supply network. In order to make efficient use of these energy sources, it is necessary to develop appropriate energy management strategies. This work presents an energy management strategy for an isolated hybrid renewable energy system with hydrogen production from bioethanol reforming. The system is based on wind-solar energy, batteries and a bioethanol reformer, which produces hydrogen to feed a fuel cell system. Bioethanol can contribute to the development of isolated areas with surplus agricultural production, which can be used to produce bioethanol. The energy management strategy takes the form of a state machine and tries to maximize autonomy time while minimizing recharging time. The proposed rule-based strategy has been validated both by simulation and experimentally in a scale laboratory station. Both tests have shown the viability of the proposed strategy complying with the specifications imposed and a good agreement between experimental and simulation results.  2018 by the authors.","Energy management; Hydrogen production; Isolated power systems; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells; Renewable energy sources","Agriculture; Bioethanol; Energy management; Energy policy; Ethanol; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen production; Natural resources; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Solar energy; Solar power generation; Agricultural productions; Electricity supply network; Energy management strategies; Fuel cell system; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Isolated power system; Renewable energy source; Rule-based strategy; Energy management systems","","","","","MINECO/FEDER, (PICT2014-1607); Generalitat de Catalunya, (2017 SGR 482); Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI, (MDM-2016-0656)","Acknowledgments: All the experimental tests were performed at the PEM Fuel Cells Laboratory of the Institut de Robòtica i Informàtica Industrial (CSIC-UPC, Barcelona, Spain) and were only possible due to its advanced equipment and proficient technical staff.

Such villages can be electrified either by extending the grids of the existing power systems or by constructing isolated new power systems, with the help of renewable energy sources. Conventional methods face problems regarding its affordability. Renewable energy based power system is possible option for the electrification of these villages. This is challenge in front of researchers to regulate the output power to cope with load demand, as RES are whether dependent with varying daily and seasonal patterns. Combining the renewable energy generation with energy storage bank & ac power from substation will enable the power generated from a renewable energy sources to be more reliable, affordable and used more efficiently. If the normal source of power, most often the serving utility, if fails, emergency and standby power systems are designed to provide an alternate source of power. As reliability of these types of systems is critical and good design practices are essential. RES's based solar systems are a potentially significant solution to rural ac electricity needs for continuity of electrical supply. © 2015 IEEE.","AVR microcontroller; battery storage system; continuous supply; isolated area; renewable energy","Electric energy storage; Electric utilities; Information science; Microcontrollers; Natural resources; Photovoltaic cells; Rural areas; Standby power systems; AVR microcontrollers; Battery storage system; continuous supply; isolated area; Renewable energies; Renewable energy resources","","","","","","","Maheshappa H.D., Nagaraju J., Murthy M.V.K., An improved Maximum power point tracker using a step-up convertor with current locked loop, Renewable Energy, 13, pp. 195-201, (1998); Hussein K.H., Et al., Maximum photovoltaic power tracking: An algorithm for rapidly changing atmosphere conditions, Proc.Inst.Elect.Eng., 142, pp. 59-64, (1995); Veeracharya M., Senjyu T., Uezato K., Neural-networkbased Maximum power point tracking of coupleinductor interleaved boostconvertor supplied Pvsystem using fussy controller, IEEE Electron, 50, 4, pp. 749-758, (2003); Haung F., Tein D., James, A Microcontroller Based Automatic Sun Tracker Combined with a New Solar Energy Conversion Unit, (1998); Maity J., Kumar Mitra S., Majee J., Choudhari S., Bera J., Development of An Efficient Photovoltaic MPPT Controller, (2012); Hau C., Lin J., Shen C., Implementation of a DSP-Controlled Photovoltaic System with Peak Power Tracking, (1998); Kobayashi K., Matsuo H., Sekine Y., An Excellent operating point Tracker of the Solar-Cell Power Supply system, Eftichios Kostas, Kostas Kalaitzakis, Member, IEEE, and Nicholas C.

The field-oriented controlled voltage source inverter is employed for speed control of the SPMSM drive under variation in solar irradiation. The MATLAB/SIMULINK environment is used to model the control of a PV power based SPMSM drive. The performance of the developed system is investigated under wide changes in operating conditions.

During 2013-16, the Queensland government in Australia, examined establishing a fair and reasonable retail Feed-in Tariff (FiT) policy, noting it regulates state retail electricity consumption prices. A combined cost avoidance and stakeholder analysis was applied to show that determination of a fair and reasonable FiT for all stakeholders, while aspirational, is difficult to achieve. Typically, agreement on a fair tariff rate will depend on stakeholders’ relative position in energy supply chains (service providers, retailers, suppliers, customers, advocates), and interpretations of fairness that can be shaped by competition in the supply area. Also, increases in financial benefits to PV customers might be considered unreasonable by non-PV customers and retailers that experience increases in electricity prices and operating costs. Importantly, the application of a retail FiT in regional and isolated areas requires careful energy policy design, taking account of network losses, remote and isolated customer metering, cost effective network control technologies, and diesel generator operating limits. The study also observed that shifting funding of FiT schemes from electricity distributors to competitive retailers will likely have negative consequences for retail FiT offerings and PV customer servicing. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity exports; Feed-in tariff policy; Solar PV system","Australia; Queensland; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Electric utilities; Sales; Solar power generation; Supply chains; Cost avoidances; Electricity export; Electricity system; Feed-in tariff; Feed-in tariff policy; Photovoltaics; Policy problem; Solar photovoltaic electricity; Solar photovoltaic system; Tariff policy; cost analysis; electricity supply; energy policy; export; photovoltaic system; policy analysis; retailing; solar power; stakeholder; Operating costs","","","","","","","(2017); Ayompe L., Duffy A., Feed-in tariff design for domestic scale grid-connected PV systems using high resolution household electricity demand data, Energy Policy, 61, pp. 619-627, (2013); Bahadori A., Nwaoha C., A review on solar energy utilisation in Australia, Renew.

Malaysia, a tropical country, has the potential to promote solar power generation in these isolated areas. The organic Rankine cycle (ORC) using solar thermal energy as the heat source could be an attractive approach to off-grid power generation. In this study, a 1 kWe solar ORC with a parabolic trough collector (PTC) is proposed. The ORC utilizes R245fa as the working fluid and Therminol VP1 as the heat transfer medium between the PTC and ORC. Thermodynamic analysis of the ORC is performed, predicting the performance of the ORC and the operating conditions of the PTC. Based on the design requirements of the PTC from the power cycle analysis, process of sizing the PTC is conducted via a numerical model. Seven sets of heat collector elements (HCE) are examined. The effects of absorber tube material, selective coating on the outer surface of the absorber tube, and the absorber tube diameter on the PTC performance are presented. Simulation results show that HCE with 6 mm of SS316L absorber tube, enclosed with 11 mm of Pyrex borosilicate glass tube, has the highest collector efficiency of 62.25%. The receiver length required is 8.05 m and the aperture width of the collector is 3.54 m.

The three-phase induction motor could be a prevailing solution for the existing dc motor water pumping system since the cost of the system is high. The controller for a photovoltaic powered induction motor water pumping system without using any battery or any chemical charge/storage element is presented. Proposed system has a modified Two-Inductor Boost Converter (TIBC), analog circuit based MPPT, and a full-bridge three-phase Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) connected to induction motor and pump. The modified TIBC topology has features like high voltage gain, low input current ripple, with further improvement on the use of maximum power point technique (MPPT) algorithm for the efficient utilization of available solar power. The system also achieves a more competent, consistent, maintenance-free and an low-priced solution for ac motors. An algorithmic rule supporting power-seeking controller adjusts the motor speed position to realize the MPPT operation of the photovoltaic array. As a result, the system may be a promising key to be employed in isolated locations, to deliver water in remote/isolated areas. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

The problem is how to furnish an electric power suitable to drive an irrigation pump for agricultural purposes in isolated areas using solar PV panels. This paper includes the simulation and analysis of a variable speed drive of a 3-phase, 220V, 50Hz, 5.4hp, submersed; squirrel cage induction motor fed by a solar PV panel through DC/DC converter controlled by a maximum power point tracker (MPPT), and DC/AC converters controlled by a space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) technique through a Sensorless field oriented control. This motor equipped with a centrifugal submersible pump drawing water from deep Wells in remote areas during daylight. This speed Sensorless driver must overcome the high starting current problem and deals with the low illumination periods during the day. The maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of the PV panels is considered also. Speed Sensorless field oriented control (FOC), Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM) Technique, and Matlab computer package are adopted for this purpose.

Photovoltaic (PV) solar energy powered reverse osmosis (RO) system can be the best option in secluded and isolated areas of the world that are suffering from a shortage of electricity energy and drinking water. This technique is likely to be the lowest energy demanding technology among other desalination techniques. Further, adopting measures like energy recovery devices, hybrid pretreatment process, and battery-less system reduces overall cost of the system. But, the capital cost of the system is still too high to support this technology competitively in the market.

The role of the MPPT is to force the system for working at the maximum point for each change of the illumination or the temperature. We present in first the classical technique, by explaining how we can obtain the maximum power under a variable meteorological condition. In P&O strategy, for big value of disturbance step we can get quickly the desired point but with a large oscillation. Small value of disturbance step makes very slow system and affects the responding time. By using fuzzy logic technique the appropriate disturbance step is produced in order to obtain a fast system with an acceptable precession. The simulation of the photovoltaic pumping chain is constructed under Matlab/Simulink, when the effectiveness of the fuzzy MPPT strategy is shown by the obtained results, which makes its application for controlling solar panels very interesting. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Fuzzy logic; MPPT; P&O; PV pumping; Solar panel","","","","","","","","Meekhun D., Boitier V., Dilhac J.M., Blin G., An automated and economic system for measuring of the current-voltage characteristics of photovoltaic cells and modules, IEEE International Conference on Sustainable Energy Technologies, Singapore, (2008); Bouzelata Y., Kurt E., Chenni R., Altin N., Design and simulation of a unified power quality conditioner fed by solar energy, Int.

This paper presents a study and design of a complete hybrid system for providing the electrical loads in a family house in Palestine according to their energy requirements.A computer program is developed to achieve this and to determine the specifications of the whole system components. It uses the data of wind and solar radiation measurements of the selected rural zone and all the required information about the electrical loads. Also, the hybrid systems minimizing, simultaneously, the total cost throughout the useful life of the installation, pollutant emissions (CO 2) and dump load are taken into consideration.It is found that providing electricity to a family house in a rural zone using hybrid systems is very beneficial and competitive with the other types of conventional energy sources, especially considering the decreasing prices of these systems and their increasing efficiencies and reliability. They have also the advantage of maintaining a clean environment. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Design; Economics; Photovoltaic; Rural region; Wind energy","Palestine; Carbon dioxide; Design; Economics; Electric loads; Photovoltaic effects; Pollution; Power quality; Rural areas; Sun; Wind power; Clean environment; Conventional energy sources; Dump load; Electrical load; Hybrid power systems; Isolated areas; Minimizing costs; Palestine; Photovoltaic; Pollutant emission; Power supply; Renewable energy source; Rural region; Solar radiation measurements; System components; Total costs; Useful life; carbon dioxide; computer; cost-benefit analysis; energy efficiency; experimental design; hybrid; installation; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; rural area; solar radiation; suspended load; wind power; Hybrid systems","","","","","","","Elhadidy M.A., Performance evaluation of hybrid (wind/ solar/diesel) power systems, Renew Energ, 26, 3, pp. 401-413, (2002); Kord H., Rohani A., An integrated hybrid power supply for off-grid applications fed by wind/photovoltaic/fuel cell energy systems, pp. 1-11, (2009); Dufo-Lopez R., Bernal-Agustin J.L., Multi-objective design of PV-wind-diesel-hydrogen-battery systems, Renew Energ, 33, 12, pp. 2559-2572, (2008); Mahmoud M.M., Ibrik H.I., Techno-economic feasibility of energy supply of remote villages in Palestine by PV- systems, diesel generators and electric grid, Renew Sust Energ Rev, 10, pp. 128-138, (2006); Meteorological measurements in West Bank/Nablus & Ramallah, (2006); Ai B., Yang H., Shen H., Liao X., Computer-aided design of PV/wind hybrid system, Renew Energ, 28, 10, pp. 1491-1512, (2003); Daud A.K., Mahmoud M.M., Solar powered induction motor-driven water pump operating on a desert well, simulation and field tests, Renew Energ, 30, 5, pp. 701-714, (2005); Lund H., Duic N., Krajacic G., Carvalho M.G., Two energy system analysis models:a comparison of methodologies and results, Energ, 32, 6, pp. 948-954, (2007); Ahmad G.E., Photovoltaic-powered rural zone family house in Egypt, Renew Energ, 26, 3, pp. 379-390, (2002); Sukamongkol Y., Chungpaibulpatana S., Ongsakul W., A simulation model for predicting the performance of a solar photovoltaic system with alternating current loads, Renew Energ, 27, 2, pp. 237-258, (2002); Hamrouni N., Jraidi M., Cherif A., Solar radiation and ambient temperature effects on the performance of a PV pumping system, Revue des Energies Renouvelables, 11, 1, pp. 95-106, (2008); Valesco M., Probst O., Acevedo S., Theory of wind-electric water pumping, Renew Energ, 29, 6, pp. 873-893, (2004); Zaharim A., Najid N., Razali A., Sopian K., The suitability of statistical distribution in fitting wind speed data, WSEAS Trans Math, 7, 12, pp. 718-727, (2008); Skarstein O., Ulhen K., Design considerations with respect to long-term diesel saving in wind/diesel plants, Wind Eng, 13, 2, pp. 72-87, (1989); Messenger R.A., Ventre J., Photovoltaic systems engineering, (2010)","A.-K.

This design process includes the mini-grid power system with desalination plant and economic analysis for the whole project life cycle. The mini-grid power supply introduces solar power as the sole power supply after considering the geographical conditions of rural areas that make it not viable to build transmission line interconnection with the existing National Grid. Currently, these remote areas are highly depending on diesel generators which the transportation cost of fuel is often unaffordable. Furthermore, natural disasters such as tsunami, flood, earthquake, typhoon and volcanic eruption usually results in isolated areas which creates plenty of opportunities for renewable energy applications in emergency relief conditions where the massive destruction of infrastructures for power and clean water supply usually took place. The design scenario of mini-grid power system will be utilising solar and batteries as the energy storage system. This mini-grid power system will be supplying reliable power supply for desalination plant to provide clean water supply. The economic issues that will be considered are the initial capital cost invested, the total net present cost (NPC), the cost of electricity (COE) generated by the system per kWh and the simple payback time (SPBT) for the project. In addition, this project will support the renewable energy applications to reduce the green house gas (GHG) emission as following Malaysia's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emission intensity by 40% by 2020. The simulation studies will be based on an actual set of conditions in a remote area in Pulau Tuba, Langkawi using HOMER. Experimental prototype of mini-grid inverter and desalination plant are developed to verify the reliability of power and water supply. © 2012 IEEE.","Desalination; Homer; rural; solar","Costs; Desalination; Economic analysis; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Optimization; Product design; Rural areas; Solar energy; Water supply; Capital costs; Clean water supply; Cost of electricity; Desalination plant; Design process; Diesel generators; Economic issues; Emergency relief; Energy storage systems; Experimental prototype; Geographical conditions; Homer; Hybrid power systems; Isolated areas; Malaysia; National Grid; Natural disasters; Net present cost; Payback time; Power supply; Power system optimization; Project life cycle; Reliable power supply; Remote areas; Renewable energy applications; Rural community; Seawater desalination plants; Simulation studies; solar; Solar-powered; Transportation cost; Volcanic eruptions; Water filtration","","","","","","","Government Transformation Programme; Garzia-Rodriguez L., Et al., Comparison of solar technologies for applications in seawater desalination, Desalination, 142, pp. 135-142, (2002); Garzia-Rodriguez L., Gomez-Camacho C., Perspectives of solar-assisted seawater distillation, Desalination, 136, pp. 213-218, (2000); The American Heritage Science Dictionary: Houghton Mifflin Company [Online]; Holland F.A., Siqueiros J., Santoyo S., Heard C.L., Santoyo E.R., Water Purification Using Heat Pumps, (1999); Masters G.M., Renewable and Efficient Electric Power System, (2004); Al-Alawi A., Islam S., Estimation of Electricity Demand for Remote Area Power Supply Systems including Water Desalination and Demand Side Management Models; Edwards D., Negnevitsky M., Designing a Wind-Diesel Hybrid Remote Area Power Supply System, ICSET 2008","","","","","2012 IEEE International Power Engineering and Optimization Conference, PEOCO 2012","6 June 2012 through 7 June 2012","Melaka","91838","","978-146730661-4","","","English","IEEE Int.

Micro Grid is an isolated power system that has generators and power loads. For isolated area Micro Grid is an ideal power system for generating electrical power with renewable energy resources like the solar and wind energy. However generations with renewable energy resources cannot meet the demand of loads securely. So smart applications with communication infrastructure are required to control and monitor the power system. The communication infrastructure for smart power grid can be classified as Home Area network (HAN), Neighborhood Area Network (NAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN).

The technology improvement in the field of building integrated photovoltaic systems, along with the governmental financial incentives for boosting the corresponding energy sector, have increased the interest of installing small scale photovoltaic systems not only in remote dwellings but also in grid-connected households. The penetration of photovoltaic systems in densely populated areas has made people even more familiar with them and therefore people with environmental consciousness are more likely to adopt the specific technology. In this context, the present work aims in highlighting the capabilities of building integrated photovoltaic systems along with battery storage devices in covering the electrical needs of a typical dwelling using real electricity demand and meteorological data based on Typical Meteorological Year time series. The system is simulated on an hourly basis by using an integrated numerical code that has been developed by the Soft Energy Applications & Environmental Protection Laboratory of the Mechanical Engineering Dept. of Piraeus University of Applied Sciences in Greece.

However, photovoltaic (PV) power plants have not yet been developed sufficiently in the country, and its applications such as PV pumping, solar distillation, and solar heating. The main problem is the high maintenance, operating costs, fossil-fuel transportation, and CO2 emission of Bordj Badji Mokhtar's (BBM's) diesel power plant that exhibits a noteworthy issue in south Algeria. This paper presents the results of a theoretical and experimental study for PV/diesel hybrid energy system (HES) considering the load demand profile and the solar radiation in isolated area of south Algeria. Suggested hybridization based on a renewable energy with a view to an improved environment is promising. Study results show the performance of PV/diesel system based on solar radiation. The experiment load curve in this typical area may conduct the diesel generator to operate at 60% to 70% of its nominal power with less fuel consumption, and it has been verified during this study that the implementation of a PV/diesel hybrid system is efficient for higher load and higher solar radiation. Results and discussions are encouraging considering less emission of greenhouse gases and less storage of fuel, which drives the government to draw a political arrangement for the improvement of cleaner forms of electricity generation. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","CO<sub>2</sub> emission; diesel power plant; fuel consumption; hybrid energy system (HES); PV generator; solar radiation; South Algeria","Carbon dioxide; Diesel power plants; Distillation; Distillation equipment; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuel consumption; Fuel storage; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid systems; Operating costs; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Algeria; CO2 emissions; Electricity generation; Fuel transportations; Hybrid energy system; PV generators; Renewable energies; Solar distillation; Solar power generation","","","","","World Bank Group, WBG","The Algerian government has been promoting the exploit of renewable energy by means of a series of laws and official programs.

Smart home systems are designed for a wide band of applications such as healthcare, power management, safety and security. In Egypt, we are suffering from an electrical power shortage because the production is not sufficient for the actual consumption. In addition, there are some isolated areas not covered by the National Grid. Because of this persisting challenge, the need for finding solutions arose. Egypt is a developing country with limited resources, consequently economic and power saving focused solutions are needed. In this paper, a simple integrated design of a smart green house is introduced as a solution for a common Egyptian home to save the consumed power from the National Grid. This design has two main pillars: First, a smart system that controls the power consumption through monitoring the activity in the home to save the power as much as possible. This system comprises of a wireless network of controllers. Each controller monitors and controls a specific area considered a separate zone. These zone controllers exchange the current data and control parameters with a master unit, which provides supervision and control of the entire system. In addition, the system can be monitored and configured locally through a wall mounted touch screen or remotely using a mobile phone or web interface. Second, a solar power supply system equipped with a two degree of freedom sun tracker to partially or fully power the loads and hence reduces the power consumption from the National Grid. The solar system is integrated with the smart supervision system through a wireless link to the master unit. © 2017 IEEE.","control parameters; master unit; Smart green house","Automation; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Developing countries; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Solar energy; Touch screens; Control parameters; Green homes; Green house; Master unit; National Grid; Power; Service-based; Simple++; Smart green house; Smart-home system; Controllers","","","","","","","Gaddam S., Mukhopadhyay C., Gupta G.S., Elder care based on cognitive sensor network, IEEE Sensors Journal, 11, 5, pp. 574-581, (2011); Pham M., Mengistu Y., Do H.M., Sheng W., Cloud-based smart home environment (CoSHE) for Home Healthcar, IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering, (2016); Han J., Choi C.-S., Lee I., More efficient home energy management system based on zigbee communication and infrared remote controls, IEEE Trans. on Consumer Electronics, 57, 1, pp. 85-89, (2011); Gill K., Yang S., Yao F., Lu X., A ZigBee-based home automation system, IEEE Trans. on Consumer Electronics, 55, 2, pp. 422-430, (2009); Suh S., Ko Y.-B., Design and implementation of intelligent home control systems based on active sensor networks, IEEE Trans. on Consumer Electronics, 54, 3, pp. 1177-1184, (2008); Byun J., Jeon B.J., Noh J., Kim Y., Park S., An intelligent self-adjusting sensor for smart home services based on zigbee communication, IEEE Trans. on Consumer Electronics, 58, 3, pp. 794-802, (2012); Pan M.-S., Yeh L.-W., Chen Y.-A., Lin Y.-H., Tseng Y.-C., A WSN-Based intelligent light control system considering user activities and profiles, IEEE Sensors Journal, 8, 10, pp. 1710-1721, (2008); Amsalu B.O.S., Afghah F., Limbrick D., Homaifar A., Design and implementation of an autonomous wireless sensor-based smart home, 24th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks, (2015); Ptru I.-I., Caraba M., Brbulescu M., Gheorghe L., Smart home IoT System, IEEE Conference Publications, (2016); Khan M., Silva B.N., Han K., Internet of things based energy aware smart home control system, IEEE Access, 4, pp. 7556-7566, (2016); Wei S.Z., Zhang W., Song A., A hybrid sensor network system for home monitoring applications, IEEE Trans. on Consumer Electronics, 53, 4, pp. 1434-1439, (2007); Ji J., Liu T., Shen C., Wu H., Liu W., Su M., Chen S., Jia Z., A human-centered smart home system with wearable-sensor behavior analysis, IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering, (2016); Alsadoon M.A., Prasad P., Pham L., Elchouemi A., Impact of wireless communications technologies on elder people healthcare: Smart home in Australia, 13th International Joint Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering, (2016); Trabelsi W., Azzouz R., Bechikh S., Said L.B., Leveraging evolutionary algorithms for dynamic multi-objective optimization scheduling of multi-tenant smart home appliances, IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC, (2016)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2017 Intelligent Systems Conference, IntelliSys 2017","7 September 2017 through 8 September 2017","London","135475","","978-150906435-9","","","English","Intell.

But the amount of power available from these natural resources will vary continuously from place to place and time to time depending on its geographical locations, terrains, altitude, climatic conditions. So the energy supplied from these sources will be fluctuating in nature. Hybrid energy system is an excellent option for supplying small isolated power systems (SIPS) and remote villages where conventional grid cannot reach due to technical and economical reasons. The report discusses hybrid energy systems. The reliability of supply is the major concern in the performance evaluation of hybrid energy systems. Several methods for evaluating reliability evaluation have been explained in this report. The present dissertation analyses the reliability of a typical hybrid energy system consisting of a solar PV system in conjunction with a diesel generating set to supply an isolated area. In this context, it must be understood that different reliability assessment methods have their own limitation.","","","","","","","","","Baring-Gould I., Golden, Colorado: National Renewable Energy Laboratory, (1998); Lambert T., Homer L.P., The micro-power optimization model, Soft-ware Developed, (2004)","","","","","","","","","09739769","","","","English","Int.

As the current trend is to use larger trough designs the need for higher accuracy is generally more important. Concentrating solar power (CSP) companies developing and deploying collectors need to meet stringent optical performance requirements and thus require accurate surface characterization instruments to validate that performance. All reflective characterization processes are sensitive to the instrument resolution, experimental setup, data fitting process, and analysis. Small changes in any of these factors can impact the estimated optical performance. It is desirable to have total local surface measurement uncertainties less than 0.5 milliradians (mrad) for a parabolic trough reflector and many instruments are capable of achieving this. Most surface characterization instruments perform a fitting process on measured data that yields a best fit description of the collector surface using some sort of polynomial. Because of this relationship it is desirable to have a robust fitting process. The type and order of the fitted polynomial and fitting process are the two major contributors to describing a facet's surface based on the measured data. The order of the polynomial can increase or decrease the accuracy of surface description relative to the true surface. This is a function of the existing aberrations in the facet and the surface naturally described by the polynomial. An accurate description of a surface is typically obtained by performing a least squares fit on measured surface data relative to the polynomial. The best analytical description of the surface is achieved when residual errors relative to the polynomial are minimized. The difference between measured data and the best fit description is completed using an iterative process. However, not all surface imperfections on a single reflector can be accurately described with a polynomial as an exact mathematical description of the surface can never be truly achieved. Local positional errors exist in isolated areas of a facet cannot always be fit accurately. The sensitivity in the best fit description of the surface and the surface resulting from the fitting process using higher order polynomials will be discussed in this paper. The change in calculated facet location and surface slope are compared to determine the sensitivity of the process. The results are then used to calculate the intercept factor using ray tracing and estimate the sensitivity in this calculated performance metric.

The analysis is addressed from energy, economic and environmental perspective. A specific application for Argentina in which fourteen locations are analyzed is considered. Results show that solar concentration technologies can be an economically and environmentally viable alternative. Levelized cost of energy (LCOE) ranges between 2.5 and 16.9 c€/kWh/m2 and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions avoided range between 33 and 348 kgCO2/(m2·year). CPC technology stands out as the most recommendable technology when the working fluid temperature ranges from 373 K to 423 K. As the working fluid temperature increases the differences between the LCOE values of the CPC and LFC technologies decrease. When 523 K is reached LFC technology is the one which presents the lowest LCOE values for all analyzed sites, while the LCOE values of PTC technology are close to CPC technology values. Results show that solar concentration technologies have reached economic and environmental competitiveness levels under certain scenarios, mainly linked to solar resource available, thermal level requirements and solar technology cost. © 2017 by the authors.","Feasibility; Greenhouse gas emissions; Heat process; Solar thermal energy","Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Solar energy; Compound parabolic collector; Feasibility; Heat process; Industrial processs; Levelized cost of energies; Linear Fresnel collectors (LFC); Parabolic trough collectors; Solar thermal energy; Environmental technology","","","","","","","Primary Energy Consumption-Leading Countries 2014, (2015); Key World Energy Statistics 2015, (2015); Moreno I., Palenzuela P., América Latina.

The energy demands of these remote, isolated communities are met by diesel operated power systems. These systems are often highly polluting and with time, an effort is made to make a transition to systems wherein single or multiple renewable energy sources are used to augment the diesel generators and thereby reduce the environmental footprint. Majority of such off-grid hybrid systems include a massive battery bank to store excess energy to supply the user when the renewable is inefficient. Inclusion of such large batteries results in additional investment costs and recycling issues. Therefore it is necessary to minimise the battery size as far as possible, and operate the system under a strategy to ensure maximum utilisation of renewable supplies and minimal DG usage. In this paper the power management strategy for a PV-battery and VSDG system was developed. A battery was modelled in MATLAB and four different battery operation algorithms were simulated for a set of data comprising of load and solar power output for every ten minute period for a day and the effective usage of DG was compared and analysed. © 2015 IEEE.","DG-Diesel Generator; off-grid hybrid; PV-photovoltaic; VSDG-Variable Speed Diesel Generator","Developing countries; Electric batteries; Energy management; Hybrid systems; Investments; Power control; Power management; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Diesel generators; Environmental footprints; Isolated community; Off-grids; Photovoltaic; Power management strategies; Renewable energy source; Variable speed diesel generators; Electric power transmission networks","","","","","","","Ltd.

The New Valley is the largest governorates in Egypt which occupies 45.8% of the total area of the Country and 65% of the Western Desert and it is the least densely populated governorate in Egypt. However, New Valley has started to receive the migrated people from the Nile valley and Delta region and the demand for the energy is continuously increasing. However, the rural area in New Valley still suffers from lack of access to energy services. The very high transmission losses and costs are the main challenges for electrification in this area. Then, it is worth to investigate the opportunities for distributed energy generation. This area of Egypt receives some of the highest solar radiation in the world (up to 3000 kW h per square meters per year), making it a prime location for use of this resource. In this study, performance and economic assessment of a small scale stand-alone solar thermal co-generation plant using diathermic oil is presented. This configuration is considered as a promising and sustainable solution to provide electricity and heat to an isolated area satisfying the local loads. Parabolic trough plant has been modeled in TRNSYS simulation environment integrated with the Solar Thermal Electric Components (STEC) model library. Both solar and power cycle performances have been modeled based on the solar energy data of the plant site. The mirrors area and the solar collectors have been designed to optimize the incident solar energy. As a result, the parabolic trough solar power plant can produce 6 MW of electric power and 21.5 MW of heat power with an overall efficiency of about 85%. The analysis demonstrated that the solar operation time of the CSP plant in the selected site can be expanded to run during the all day without recurring to fossil fuel backup. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of the proposed power plant is estimated to be equal to 1.25 USD/kW h. The avoided GHG emissions are equal to about 7300 toe/year. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The system can be used in isolated areas without access to electricity grid. The plant is installed at the Federal University of Ceará, in Fortaleza, Brazil. The plant consists of a wind turbine (1 kW permanent magnet) and 4 polycrystalline PV modules (87 Wp each), 5 batteries (150 Ah each) and 1 power electronic converter (1 kW). A datalloger is used for acquisition and storage of data (wind speed, global irradiance, water flow and electrical data). The present study uses data from four non-consecutive days in November/2014 and December/2014; in the first day only PV and the battery bank supply the load. The recorded mean flow was 25.26 L/min, showing little variation, even with intermittence of the resources, condition minimized by the energy storage. As a consequence of the energy storage, the hybrid system shows low operation request, enhancing the life cycle and consequently reducing the plant replacement costs. © 2015, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

Results were obtained from experimental work carried out on a pilot plant operating in different configurations. The use of a simple device to increase solar radiation intensity (solar concentrator) was tested, with results showing that it facilitated better performance. A comparison between transparent and black-painted glass reactors was also made, showing no difference between the two casings. Further, the effect of an increase in water temperature was analysed in detail. Temperature was found to play an important role in the disinfection process, even in cases of limited solar radiation intensities, although a synergistic effect of water heating and solar radiation for effective microbial inactivation was confirmed. Reactor design is also discussed, highlighting the importance of having a plug flow to avoid zones that do not contribute to the overall effectiveness of the process. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","disinfection; drinking water; glass reactor; solar radiation intensity; temperature","Disinfection; Glass; Pilot plants; Potable water; Sun; Temperature; drinking water; Disinfection process; glass reactor; Glass reactors; Isolated areas; Microbial inactivation; Overall effectiveness; Plug flow; Reactor designs; Safe drinking water; solar radiation intensity; Solar water disinfection; Synergistic effect; Treatment plants; Water disinfections; Water temperatures; bioreactor; disinfection; drinking water; experimental study; facilitation; solar radiation; temperature effect; water temperature; article; disinfection; experimental study; heating; infrared radiation; reactor; reactor design; solar disinfection; solar radiation; temperature; water temperature; Solar radiation","","","","","","","Montiel A., Welte B., Barbier J.M., Improvement of slow sand filtration, Environ.

The advances in desalination technologies clearly show that desalinated water can be used as a substitute for freshwater to be used as potable water. A breakthrough in reverse osmosis costs has been reached, particularly in decreasing energy consumption. The introduction of nanotechnology in the membrane manufacture has resulted in reducing the volume of rejected brine which in turn alleviates the brine disposal issue. Several recent studies show that desalinated water for development of isolated areas is economically competitive to transportation of freshwater by pipeline. The introduction of solar energy to power desalination process has given a new dimension to the expansion of desalination technology. Several studies show the importance of solar desalination in countries suffering from freshwater shortage, particularly in isolated areas.

As a key driven country development, electricity has a significant impact to the growth of telecommunication industries. In such situations, it is therefore difficult to guarantee the reliability of the telecommunication network, in particular, the electricity supply for the base transceiver station (BTS). To overcome this shortage, locally available renewable energy sources can be a solution as a power supply for a BTS. This study proposes the use of the integrated photovoltaic (PV) system as a power sources for BTS in the remote and isolated areas where the electricity from the grid is unavailable. The results show that the use of PV system is capable of supplying the electrical load requirement of BTS and is very feasible in financial analysis. The designed PV system output can produce 1.16 kW, while BTS load is 1.15 kW. We found that the integrated PV system is capable of handling BTS load. In economic perspective, the investment cost to deploy PV system is affordable due to the advantage of PV system, which is easy to maintain and operate. © 2018 IEEE.","base transceiver station; photovoltaic system;

However, the microgrid faces various challenges in operational management because it deals with a multitude of energy sources mainly comprising renewables (municipal solid waste incineration and solar and wind energy), fuels (natural gas, hydrogen, and biofuel), and batteries. In this work, we developed a mixed-integer linear programming model for cost-efficient and environmentally friendly scheduling in the microgrid operation. The model provides optimal schedules with minimal cost or reduced environmental impacts, e.g., global warming potential, while satisfying the balance of electricity supply and demand. Notably, an additional set of diversity constraints is incorporated within the model to ensure reasonable allocation of electricity generation from each source, thereby allowing us to maintain grid reliability. To demonstrate the applicability and utility of the model, a case study of a hypothetical microgid system in Singapore Island is presented. A comparison result with the national grid system clearly proves the cost efficiency and environmental friendliness of the microgrid. We also investigated the effects of uncertainty in local demands and seasonal weather conditions on the microgrid scheduling, suggesting capacity planning to manage the dependency on national grid and renewable sources. © 2012 American Chemical Society.","","Cost effectiveness; Electric generators; Energy management; Environmental impact; Global warming; Hydrogen; Power quality; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Waste incineration; Wind power; Capacity planning; Comparison result; Cost efficiency; Cost-efficient; Electricity generation; Electricity infrastructure; Electricity supply; Energy source; Environmental benefits; Environmental friendliness; Environmentally-friendly; Global warming potential; Grid reliability; Isolated areas; Micro grid; Minimal cost; Mixed integer linear programming; National Grid; National grid systems; Operational management; Optimal schedule; Renewable sources; Renewables; Singapore; Weather conditions; Scheduling","","","","","","","Platt G., Berry A., Cornforth D., What Role for Microgrids?, Smart Grid: Integrating Renewable, Distributed & Efficient Energy, pp. 185-207, (2012); Lasseter R.H., Paigi P., Proceedings of 35th Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference, 6, pp. 4285-4290, (2004); Lasseter R.H., Proceedings of 2002 IEEE Power Engineering Society Winter Meeting, 1, pp. 305-308, (2002); Venkataramanan G., Marnay C., A Larger Role for Microgrids, IEEE Power Energy Mag., 6, 3, pp. 78-82, (2008); Tanrioven M., Reliability and Cost-benefits of Adding Alternate Power Sources to an Independent Micro-grid Community, J.

Standalone microgrid is an effective solution for the electricity needs in remote areas. Electricity generation using energy sources like solar which depends highly on the weather conditions, can be unpredictable. Availability of such renewable energy sources may not match with the load demand. Thus providing electricity on a regular mode in all times to meet the demand is a big challenge. Implementation of a controller in the system helps in solving this problem. In this work, selection of different sources in a hybrid solar and diesel system according to the weather conditions using a fuzzy logic controller is implemented. This proposed method also provides constant dc bus voltage in the system. © 2018 IEEE.","Fuzzy Logic Controller; hybrid system; Microgrid; PV system","Controllers; Energy management; Hybrid systems; Meteorology; Microgrids; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; DC-bus voltages; Effective solution; Electricity generation; Energy demands; Energy source; Fuzzy controllers; Fuzzy logic controllers; Renewable energy source; Fuzzy logic","","","","","","","Colson C.M., Nehrir M.H., A review of challenges to real-Time power management of microgrids, 2009 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting, pp. 1-8, (2009); Yang N., Paire D., Gao F., Miraoui A., Power management strategies for microgrid-A short review, 2013 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting, pp. 1-9, (2013); Guerrero J.M., Chandorkar M., Lee T.L., Loh P.C., Advanced control architectures for intelligent microgrids-part i: Decentralized and hierarchical control, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 60, 4, pp. 1254-1262, (2013); Li Y., Li Y.W., Power management of inverter interfaced autonomous microgrid based on virtual frequency-voltage frame, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 2, 1, pp. 30-40, (2011); Sao C.K., Lehn P.W., Control and power management of converter fed microgrids, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 23, 3, pp. 1088-1098, (2008); Colson C.M., Nehrir M.H., Comprehensive real-Time microgrid power management and control with distributed agents, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 4, 1, pp. 617-627, (2013); Shihabudheen K.V., Pillai G.N., Recent advances in neuro-fuzzy system: A survey, Knowledge-Based Systems, 152, pp. 136-162, (2018); Shihabudheen S.K.R., Pillai G.N., Control for grid-connected dfig-based wind energy system using adaptive neuro-fuzzy technique, International Transactions on Electrical Energy Systems, 28, 5, (2018); Salah C.B., Ouali M., Energy management of a hybrid photovoltaic system, International Journal of Energy Research, 36, 1, pp. 130-138, (2012); Li X., Hui D., Wu L., Lai X., Control strategy of battery state of charge for wind/battery hybrid power system, IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics, (2010); Kumar T.P., Chandrashekar Y., Subrahmanyam N., Sydulu M., Control strategies of a fuzzy controlled grid connected hybrid pv/pemfc/battery distributed generation system, IEEE Power and Energy Conference at Illinois, pp. 1-6, (2015); Cheng M.W., Wang S.M., Lee Y.S., Hsiao S., Fuzzy controlled fast charging system for lithium-ion batteries, International Conference on Power Electronics and Drive Systems, pp. 2-5, (2009); Suganthi L., Iniyan S., Samuel A.A., Applications of fuzzy logic in renewable energy systems -A review, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 48, pp. 585-607, (2015); Roumila Z., Rekioua D., Rekioua T., Energy management based fuzzy logic controller of hybrid system wind/photovoltaic/diesel with storage battery, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 42, 30, pp. 19525-19535, (2017)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE","4th International Conference for Convergence in Technology, I2CT 2018","27 October 2018 through 28 October 2018","Mangalore","159130","","978-153865232-9","","","English","Int.

This paper demonstrates the solar energy prospect, the present status and dissemination schemes of SHSs in off-grid and coastal areas of Bangladesh by several government and Non-government organizations (NGOs). The country has an average daily solar radiation ranges between 4–6.5 kWh/m2. Currently, more than 3.8 million SHSs of capacity range 10–135 Wp (watt peak) with a total capacity of 150 MW have been disseminated in rural and isolated areas in Bangladesh. In this paper, ten case studies of capacity 20 Wp, 30 Wp and 42 Wp were investigated to evaluate economic viability at two randomly selected villages in Sirajgonj district and Jessore district, Bangladesh. The analysis showed that the SHSs for small business enterprise and household with small income generation are economically viable rather than only household lighting. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Bangladesh; Economic viability; Power crisis; SHSs; Solar energy","Economic analysis; Rural areas; Solar buildings; Bangladesh; Coastal area; Economic feasibilities; Economic viability; Off-grids; Power; Power crisis; Present status; Solar home system; Systems implementation; Solar energy","","","","","Asian Development Bank, ADB; World Bank Group, WBG","IDCOL stimulates the distribution of SHSs in the remote off-grid areas of Bangladesh through its POs under its solar energy program with the funding from the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, Global Environment Facility, German Development Cooperation, and German Technical Cooperation.

We present a study of the spectrophotometric properties of dwarf planet Ceres in the visual-to-infrared (VIS-IR) spectral range by means of hyper-spectral images acquired by the VIR imaging spectrometer on board the NASA Dawn mission. Methods. Disk-resolved observations with a phase angle within the 7° <α < 132° interval were used to characterize Ceres' phase curve in the 0.465-4.05 μm spectral range. Hapke's model was applied to perform the photometric correction of the dataset to standard observation geometry at VIS-IR wavelength, allowing us to produce albedo and color maps of the surface. The V-band magnitude phase function of Ceres has been computed from disk-resolved images and fitted with both the classical linear model and H-G formalism. Results. The single-scattering albedo and the asymmetry parameter at 0.55 μm are w = 0.14 ± 0.02 and ξ = -0.11 ± 0.08, respectively (two-lobe Henyey-Greenstein phase function); at the same wavelength, Ceres' geometric albedo as derived from our modeling is 0.094 ± 0.007; the roughness parameter is θ=29 ± pm. Albedo maps indicate small variability on a global scale with an average reflectance at standard geometry of 0.034 ± 0.003. Nonetheless, isolated areas such as the Occator bright spots, Haulani, and Oxo show an albedo much higher than average. We measure a significant spectral phase reddening, and the average spectral slope of Ceres' surface after photometric correction is 1.1% kA-1 and 0.85% kA-1 at VIS and IR wavelengths, respectively. Broadband color indices are V-R = 0.38 ± 0.01 and R-I = 0.33 ± 0.02. Color maps show that the brightest features typically exhibit smaller slopes. The H-G modeling of the V-band magnitude phase curve for α < 30° gives H = 3.14 ± 0.04 and G = 0.10 ± 0.04, while the classical linear model provides V(1,1,0°) = 3.48 ± 0.03 and β = 0.036 ± 0.002. The comparison of our results with spectrophotometric properties of other minor bodies indicates that Ceres has a less back-scattering phase function and a slightly higher albedo than comets and C-type objects. However, the latter represents the closest match in the usual asteroid taxonomy. © ESO, 2017.","Methods: data analysis; Minor planets, asteroids: individual: Ceres; Planets and satellites: surfaces; Techniques: imaging spectroscopy; Techniques: photometric; Techniques: spectroscopic","Asteroids; Backscattering; C (programming language); Color; Geometry; NASA; Photometry; Planets; Satellites; Solar radiation; Spectrophotometers; Spectrophotometry; Spectroscopic analysis; Spectroscopy; Methods:data analysis; Minor planets , asteroids; Planets and satellites: surfaces; Techniques: imaging spectroscopies; Techniques: photometric; Techniques: spectroscopic; Spectrometers","","","","","","","Akimov L.A., Kinematika i Fizika Nebesnykh Tel, 4, (1988); Ammannito E., DeSanctis M.C., Ciarniello M., Et al., Science, 353, (2016); Belskaya I., Shevchenko V., Icarus, 147, (2000); Bessell M.S., PASP, 102, (1990); Bowell E., Hapke B., Domingue D., Et al., Asteroids II, (1989); Buratti B.J., Britt D.T., Soderblom L.A., Et al., Icarus, 167, (2004); Carrozzo F.G., Raponi A., De Sanctis M.C., Et al., Rev.

However, the output power of these renewable sources is not constant and can diverge quickly, which has a serious effect on system frequency and the continuity of demand supply. In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a new frequency control scheme for a hybrid power system to ensure supplying a high-quality power in isolated areas. The proposed power system consists of a WTG, PV, aqua-electrolyzer (AE), fuel cell (FC), battery energy storage system (BESS), flywheel (FW) and diesel engine generator (DEG). Furthermore, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (EVs) are implemented at the customer side. A full-order observer is utilized to estimate the supply error. Then, the estimated supply error is considered in a frequency domain. The high-frequency component is reduced by BESS and FW; while the low-frequency component of supply error is mitigated using FC, EV and DEG. Two PI controllers are implemented in the proposed system to control the system frequency and reduce the supply error. The epsilon multi-objective genetic algorithm (""-MOGA) is applied to optimize the controllers' parameters. The performance of the proposed control scheme is compared with that of recent well-established techniques, such as a PID controller tuned by the quasi-oppositional harmony search algorithm (QOHSA). The effectiveness and robustness of the hybrid power system are investigated under various operating conditions.","Frequency control; Full-order observer; Hybrid power system; Multi-objective optimization; Supply balance","","","","","","","","Al-Alawi A., Al-Alawi S., Islam S., Predictive control of an integrated PV-diesel water and power supply system using an artificial neural network, Renew.

In this study the supercapacitor as energy storage, as opposed to batteries, has widely researched in recent years. Supercapacitors act like other capacitors, but their advantage is having enormous power storage capabilities. Maximum charging voltage and capacitance are two variables of storage in the supercapacitor. The supercapacitor is used as energy storage to charge a low power device wirelessly and act as a power supply. The solar energy is used as a backup power supply if there is no electricity in the remote or isolated area to charge the supercapacitor. The time taken to charge the supercapacitor depend on the amount of current rating of the solar panel. The higher the current, the shorter the time taken to charges the supercapacitor. Power supply using supercapacitor can store up to 30 Vdc using a DC-DC boost converter. © 2019 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Such off-grid technology is very promising in the Asia Pacific region where increase in population and regional development has brought an increase in energy demand. This paper presents a methodology to assess the available supply of energy from solar PV systems and the corresponding demand from non-electrified areas. Non-electrified high population density areas were extracted using global population distribution and nightlight data, while the suitability of installing solar PV systems in those areas were identified based on slope, land cover and estimated solar PV power output. Moreover, the cost and benefits of installation were estimated based on the levelized cost of electricity generation from PV (LCOEPV) and the percentage in the total household budget that can shoulder the said expense. Lastly, this study also proposed a novel and simple method to extract the power transmission lines (TLs) based on global road network and nightlight data used for defining off-grid areas. Results show that there are three general types of electrification trend in the region with only 11 out 28 countries exhibiting the ideal trend of decreasing population living in unlit areas with increasing GDP. This study also generated maps showing the spatial distribution of high potential areas for solar PV installation in Cambodia, North Korea and Myanmar as case studies. To date, the high estimated household income allotted for PV electricity is still experienced in most countries in the region, but these countries also have high initial generated electricity from PV systems. Outputs from this study can provide stakeholders with relevant information on the suitable areas for installations in the region and the expected socio-economic benefits. © 2019 by the authors.","Asia Pacific region; Electrification rates; Power output; Satellite data; Solar PV","Budget control; Data mining; Economic and social effects; Economics; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Population distribution; Population statistics; Regional planning; Solar power generation; Asia Pacific region; High population density area; Levelized cost of electricities; Power out put; Satellite data; Socio-economic benefits; Solar photovoltaic system; Solar PVs; Solar power satellites","","","","","Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, JAXA; Hitachi Global Foundation, (HS-S179)","Funding text 1: This research was funded by Hitachi Global Foundation, grant number HS-S179.

Conventional technology solutions provided by diesel generators are costly because of high maintenance and fuel supply costs and have drawbacks related to noise and especially greenhouse gas emissions. New technological solutions provided by solar and wind water pumping systems are experiencing high growth rates in recent years. Because of their high initial capital cost, many studies on their optimal sizing have been carried out. In this paper, an optimal sizing model based on Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP) and Particle Swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed. The main goal is to deal with the optimal sizing problem of hybrid PV-Wind-based water pumping system taking into account the techno-economic aspects. The developed method uses the PSO algorithm to find the optimal configuration of the studied hybrid system insuring minimum cost and satisfying a desired loss of power supply probability. A computing code is developed and a flexible graphical interface is designed. © 2018 IEEE.","LPSP; PSO optimization; PV-Wind based water pumping; Techno-economic analysis","Costs; Economic analysis; Electric power systems; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Potable water; Pumps; Reliability analysis; Loss of power supply probability; Optimal sizing; Optimisations; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization optimization; PV-wind based water pumping; Swarm optimization; Techno-Economic analysis; Water pumping; Water pumping systems; Hybrid systems","","","","","","","Bakelli Y., Et al., Optimal sizing of photovoltaic pumping system with water tank storage using LPSP concept, Solar Energy, 85, pp. 288-294; Kaldellis J.K., Et al., Experimental validation of autonomous PV-based water pumping system optimum sizing, Renewable Energy, 34, pp. 1106-1113; Gopal C., Et al., Renewable energy source water pumping systems-A literature review, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 25, pp. 351-370; Hadj Arab A., Et al., Loss-of-load probability of photovoltaic water pumping systems, Solar Energy, 76, pp. 713-723; Rawat R., Et al., A review on modeling, design methodology and size optimization of photovoltaic based water pumping, standalone and grid connected system, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 57, pp. 1506-1519; Khatib T., Et al., A review of photovoltaic systems size optimization techniques, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 22, pp. 454-465; Posadillo R., Lopez Luque R., Approaches for developing a sizing method for stand-Alone PV systems with variable demand, Renewable Energy, 33, pp. 1037-1048; Bhuiyan M.M.H., Ali Asgar M., Sizing of a stand-Alone photovoltaic power system at Dhaka, Renewable Energy, 28, pp. 929-938; Ould Bilal B., Et al., Optimal design of a hybrid solar-windbattery system using the minimization of the annualized cost system and the minimization of the loss of power supply probability (LPSP), Renewable Energy, 35, pp. 2388-2390; Markvart T., Sizing of hybrid photovoltaic-wind energy systems, Solar Energy, 57, pp. 277-281; Chel A., Et al., Simplified method of sizing and life cycle cost assessment of building integrated photovoltaic system, Energy and Buildings, 41, pp. 1172-1180; Kaabeche A., Et al., Sizing optimization of grid-independent hybrid photovoltaic/wind power generation system, Energy, 36, pp. 1214-1222; Molina M.G., Espejo E.J., Modeling and simulation of gridconnected photovoltaic energy conversion systems, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 39, pp. 8702-8707; Mellit A., Et al., Modeling and simulation of a stand-Alone photovoltaic system using an adaptive artificial neural network: Proposition for a new sizing procedure, Renewable Energy, 32, pp. 285-313; Muhsen D.H., Et al., Technoeconomic study and optimal sizing of a standalone photovoltaic water pumping system, International Transactions on Electrical Energy Systems, 27, (2017); Bouzidi B., New sizing method of PV water pumping systems, Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments, 4, pp. 1-10; Maleki A., Et al., Optimal sizing of a grid independent hybrid renewable energy system incorporating resource uncertainty, and load uncertainty, International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems, 83, pp. 514-524; Ahmadi S., Abdi S., Application of the hybrid big bang-big crunch algorithm for optimal sizing of a stand-Alone hybrid PV/wind/battery system, Solar Energy, 134, pp. 366-374; Gan L.K., Et al., Hybrid wind-photovoltaic-diesel-battery system sizing tool development using empirical approach, lifecycle cost and performance analysis: A case study in Scotland, Energy Conversion and Management, 106, pp. 479-494; Ojha V.K., Et al., Metaheuristic design of feedforward neural networks: A review of two decades of research, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 60, pp. 97-116; Lan H., Et al., Optimal sizing of hybrid PV/diesel/battery in ship power system, Applied Energy, 158, pp. 26-34","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2018 International Conference on Wind Energy and Applications in Algeria, ICWEAA 2018","6 November 2018 through 7 November 2018","Algiers","144447","","978-153866933-4","","","English","Int.

High annual average of solar radiation and available desert lands in the central parts of Iran are factors to encourage the full development of a solar chimney power plant for the thermal and electrical production of energy for various uses. The interested is in Kerman where solar radiation is much better than other areas of Iran. The obtained results clear that solar chimney power plants having 244 m diameter can produce from 25.3 to 43.2 MW h of electricity power on a site like Kerman during different months of a year, according to an estimation calculated from the monthly average of sunning. This power production is sufficient for the needs of the isolated areas and can even used to feed the main electrical grid. © 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.","electricity production; solar chimney; solar energy; solar tower; thermal power plant","Electric power transmission networks; Solar chimneys; Thermoelectric power plants; Solar chimneys; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Sun; Thermoelectric power plants; 'current; Annual average; Electric power demands; Electricity production; Off-grids; Performances analysis; Power plant performance; Solar chimney power plant; Solar towers; Thermal-power plants; Electric power demands; Electrical grids; Electricity production; Performance analysis; Power production; Solar chimney power plant; Solar towers; Thermal power plants; Solar radiation; Power plants","","","","","","","Zhou X., Wang F., Ochieng R.M., A review of solar chimney power technology, Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev., 14, pp. 2315-2338, (2010); Haaf W., Friedrich K., Mayer G., Schlaich J., Solar chimneys, Int.

A common application of HRES is in remote communities, where interconnected electrical grid is unreachable due to economics and physical reasons. Due to the long distance and difficult access to these isolated areas, electrical generation systems used in these applications must be reliable. And the reliability of the system, especially the inverter used to regulate the AC voltage, is one of the main problems associated to these systems, and it is responsible for the lack of confidence in renewable systems at several locations in Brazil. This paper shows the results of using renewable hybrid systems specially designed for isolated areas, focusing attention on reliability, efficiency and expansion flexibility. It presents the system description, mode of operation, inverter design, and experimental results measured in a pilot plant located in Lençóis Island, a small isolated community in the north region of Brazil. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Hybrid systems; Micro-turbines; Standalone systems","Brazil; Hybrid systems; Pilot plants; Ac voltage; Electrical generation; Electrical grids; Expansion flexibility; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Isolated areas; Isolated community; Micro-turbines; Mode of operations; Remote communities; Renewable energy systems; Standalone applications; Standalone systems; System description; alternative energy; electricity generation; energy resource; island; isolated population; natural resource; renewable resource; solar power; turbine; wind power; Renewable energy resources","","","","","","","Ribeiro L.A.S., Saavedra O.R., Matos J.G., Bonan G., Martins A.S.,  Small Renewable Hybrid System for Stand Alone Applications, pp. 1-7, (2009); Ribeiro L.A.S., Saavedra O.R., Matos J.G., Lima S.L., Bonan G., Martins A.S., Isolated micro-grid with renewable hybrid generation: the case of Lençóis island, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 2, 1, pp. 1-11, (2010); Flowers L., Baring-Gould I., Bianchi J., Corbus D., Drouilhet S., Elliott D., Et al., Renewables for sustainable village power, American wind energy association's windpower 2000 conference, pp. 1-10, (2000); Baring-Gould E.I., Newcomb C., Corbus D., Lalidas R., Field performance of hybrid power systems, American wind energy association's windpower 2001 conference, pp. 1-10, (2001); Foster R.E., Orozco R.C., Rubio A.R.P., Lessons learned from the Xcalak hybrid system: a seven year retrospective, Proc. of 1999 solar world conference, 1, pp. 319-328, (1999); Corbus D., Newcomb C., Yewdall Z., San Juanico hybrid power system technical and institutional assessment, Proc. of World Renewable Energy Congress VIII (WREC VIII), pp. 1-5, (2004); Jiayi H., Chuanwen J., Rong X., A review on distributed energy resources and MicroGrid, Elsevier Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 12, 9, pp. 2472-2483, (2007); Nelson V.C., Foster R.E., Clark R.N., Raubenheimer D., Wind hybrid system technology characterization, (2002); (2011); (2011); (2011); Manwell J.F., Mcgowan J.G., Rogers A.L., Wind energy explained: theory, design, and application, (2009); Wood A.P., Reliability-metric varieties and their relationships, Proc. of the reliability and maintainability symposium, pp. 110-115, (2001); Lewis E.E., Introduction to reliability engineering, (1987); Guerrero J.M., Garcia de Vicuna L., Matas J., Castilla M., Miret J., A wireless controller to enhance dynamic performance of parallel inverters in distributed generation systems, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 19, 5, pp. 1205-1213, (2004); Chen Z., Hu Y., Control of power electronic converters for distributed generation units, Proc. of IECON 2005 Conf., pp. 1317-1322, (2005); Chen Z., Hu Y., Blaabjerg F.,  Control of distributed power systems, Proc.

A Zero Energy Solar-House (ZESH) is defined, considering its fabrication, assembly systems, use of natural resources and strategies for energy efficiency, leading to low environmental impact. A Brazilian scenery is described regarding energy feeding conditions in isolated areas, the occupation of protection areas, which are coveted by real estate market and touristic exploitation, and the consequent environmental impact. The ZESH harnesses sun's energy throughout a photovoltaic (PV) system for energy generation, solar collectors for water heating and passive environmental conditioning. Besides, it has local wastewater treatment and solid waste management systems, reducing the environmental impact arising from the occupants activities. To verify the ZESH model, this study takes the Ekó House Project, an efficient solar house prototype that meets the ZESH premises. This study results in accounting greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions reduction by the solar PV electricity generation instead of diesel generators. Results point out a potential to avoid up to 14.4 t of CO2/year for one ZESH unit. It is observed that the ZESH contributes to enable the occupation of these areas by local communities or touristic exploitation with responsibility, low resources consumption and reducing the environmental impact when compared to conventional buildings, allowing these areas to develop on a sustainable way and benefiting local communities. © Copyright: CEPT University, Center for Advanced Research in Building Science & Energy, Ahmedabad First Published 2014.All rights reserved.","","Ecosystems; Electric equipment protection; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Environmental protection; Greenhouse gases; Houses; Solar buildings; Solar heating; Sustainable development; Waste treatment; Wastewater treatment; Electricity generation; Environmental conditioning; Environmental Protected Area; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Photovoltaic systems; Resources consumption; Solid waste management systems; Zero energy building (ZEB); Zero energy buildings","","","","","FUPAM","To institutions that facilitated the development and implementation of the Ekó House prototype: Eletrobrás; IEE/USP; VRERI/USP, FUPAM, LabEEE/UFSC; and to the Brazilian team for Solar Decathlon Europe 2012.","Turismo e a Dimensão Ambiental, (2009); Roteiros Do Brasil: Turismo e Sustentabilidade, (2007); Di Lascio M.A., Energia e Desenvolvimento Sustentável Para a Amazônia Rural Brasileira: Eletrificação de Comunidades Isoladas, (2009); Dias L.S., Incorporação de Sistemas Fotovoltaicos Em Envoltórias de Edificações, (2014); Residential Energy Consumption Survey, (2012); Anuário Estatístico de Energia Elétrica 2013, Empresa de Pesquisa Energética, (2013); Nota Técnica: Análise da Inserção da Geração Solar na Matriz Elétrica Brasileira, Empresa de Pesquisa Energética, (2012); Freitas K.T., Custo de geração de energia elétrica em comunidade isolada do Amazonas: Estudo preliminar do projeto NERAM, Revista Brasileira de Energia, 12, 1, (2006); Gonzalez W.A., Et al., Soluções Energéticas Para a Amazônia: Biodiesel e Óleo Vegetal in Natura, (2008); Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007, (2007); Renewable energy sources and climate change mitigation - Special report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change, IPCC, (2012); Operador Nacional Do Sistema Elétrico 2013; Pinho J.T., Et al., Soluções Energéticas Para a Amazônia: Sistemas Híbridos, (2008); Pesquisa Quantitativa Domiciliar de Avaliação Da Satisfação e de Impacto Do Programa Luz Para Todos: Principais Resultados, (2009); Project Manual - Relatório Interno, (2012); Seo L.M., Esteves J.R., Luz Para Todos: Um Marco Histórico 10 Milhões de Brasileiros Saíram Da Escuridão, (2010); Torcellini S.P., Deru M., Crawley D., Zero energy buildings: A critical look at the definition.

The particularity of isolated areas creates more risks for their energy systems planning, and the isolated areas can be considered to be a more specific analysis target than mainland areas. Various energy models and systems have been developed and applied in isolated areas. The major objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive literature review to identify, classify, evaluate and analyze the performance of different methodologies, models and energy systems for isolated areas. Therefore, effective information could be provided to support decision-making toward to appropriate energy models and systems for isolated areas with different scales and demands. This paper reviewed the forecasting techniques of energy demand and renewable energy (RE) resources, energy models, application of hybrid RE systems (HRESs), and management of energy planning for two most representative isolated areas: islands and remote villages. The uncertainty analysis of energy systems of isolated areas is also discussed. It is evident that the indigenous RE resources show great potentials for the energy system of isolated areas, especially the solar and wind resources. The various combinations of photovoltaic (PV), wind, diesel and batteries have been proven more competitive. Also, it is necessary to develop sophisticated models that are more applicable to isolated areas and that consider the distinctive characteristics, practical needs and uncertainties of isolated areas. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Energy systems;

With the rapid decrease of photovoltaic cells price, its simplicity makes it ideal for low cost, autonomous and reliable applications, such as water pumping in isolated areas with good solar irradiation. But the concept does not allow for motion control or variable-speed operation. In order to evaluate its range of application, then to optimize its sizing, we need to understand the complex interactions between the photovoltaic cells and the motor. To this end, we develop here a numerical model of our photovoltaic switched reluctance motor prototype. It takes into account the nonlinearity of photovoltaic cells and of the switched reluctance machine. Despite the uncommon operation of the photovoltaic cells, the agreement between the simulation and the measures is so far good, thus validating our modeling strategy. © 2015 IEEE.","modeling and simulation; photovoltaic motor; solar cell; switched reluctance motor","Costs; Photoelectrochemical cells; Photovoltaic cells; Reluctance motors; Solar cells; Solar power generation; Mechanical energies; Model and simulation; Modeling strategy; Photovoltaic; Solar irradiation; Switched Reluctance Machine; Switched Reluctance Motor; Variable speed operations; Electric machine theory","","","","","","","Appelbaum J., Starting and steady-state characteristics of DC motors powered by solar cell generators, IEEE Trans. on Energy Conversion, EC-1, 1, pp. 17-25, (1986); Bhat S.R., Pittet A., Sonde B.S., Performance optimization of induction motor-pump system using photovoltaic energy source, IEEE Trans. on Industry Applications, IA-23, 6, pp. 995-1000, (1987); Hall E.T., Solar Motor, (1967); Braeutigam S., Rotating Advertising Device, (1967); Marrison W.A., Apparatus for Converting Radiant Energy to Electromechanical Energy, (1959); Nakamatsu Y., Apparatus for Converting Radiant Energy Such As Light or Heat Directly into Turning Force, (1987); Izawa H., Solar Energy Motor, (1988); Coty A., Automatically Switched Photovoltaic Motor, (2012); Shea G.J., Solar Energy Magnetic Resonance Motor, (1995); Bobitski J., Iwinski D., Investigation of photoelectric motor with stationary axial diaphragm, static and dynamic characteristics, Optoelectronics Review, 12, 1, pp. 85-90, (2004); Petru L., Ungureanu C., Contribution concerning the building of some solar-electric engines.

This means that 26% of the population does not have electricity. Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) is developing small scale concentrated solar power plant using Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) that can be operated in remote, isolated areas or small islands. Some constraints of electrification in these areas are the cost of integrated grid construction is relatively high, the limitation of energy resources and the population of the area is relatively small. Reseach in concentrated solar power (parabolic trough) has been carried out by LIPI since 2010. A stand-alone power unit (""off grid"") by utilizing local energy resources, especially renewable energy, will be constructed by LIPI. A hybrid system of solar thermal and biomass energy can be a suitable choice to solve the electricity problem in the area. This option is based on the relatively good potential intensity of solar energy in some areas of Indonesia which is daily average intensity is about 4.8 kWh/m2/day.

In addition, there is an excessive consumption of energy in most systems of desalination which leads to generating gases that cause global warming. Besides, in certain countries of the world this energy is not available in great quantity. Distillation is an operation which transforms, by heating, the seawater or brackish water into vapor. Through condensation, this vapor gives water of great purity. Among the various processes, solar distillation is an interesting solution in the isolated areas. The objective of our work is to study the transfers of heat and mass in a solar distillatory. Thus, we studied the evaluation of the thermophysical properties and the effect of the properties of humid air-as binary mixture of water vapor and dry air-on the coefficient of transfer of heat by convection and the evaporative ratio of thermal coefficient of transfer and the flow of the distillate. In addition to these theoretical results, we have replicated previous experimental investigations. We have also established equations governing the operation of a solar distiller with capillary film, in the resolution based on the numerical approach based on the method of Runge-Kutta. The results obtained show that the effect of relative humidity and the differences in temperature between the pan and brine on the convective coefficient and thermophysical parameters of solar distiller. © 2013 Desalination Publications.","Efficiency; Humid air; Solar distiller; Thermophysical properties","","","","","","","","Kettab B., Water resources in Algeria: Strategies, stakes and vision, Desalination, 136, pp. 25-33, (2001); Michard G., Natural water chemistry, principles of water geochemistry, édition publisud, Université Denis Diderot, Paris7, pp. 6-7, (1985); Khedim A., Schwarzer K., Faber C., Muller C., Decentralized production of the drinking water using the solar energy, Desalination, 168, pp. 13-20, (2004); Tchinda R., Kaptouom E., Numerical simulation of the solar still performances functioning in indirect mode, Afr.

The main problems of SRM are high torque ripple, acoustic noise and vibration problems. In order to reduce these problems, a new direct torque control of 3.5 kW 8/6 SRM is proposed, which is simple and can be implemented with low cost processor. It can be seen from the simulation results that this scheme has well regulated the torque output of the motor with in hysteresis band.

Given environmental conditions, system specifications and daily load demand data, the optimal size of main system components are obtained using a sizing algorithm. Different renewable energy systems are compared using yearly simulations, on hourly base via specialized commercial software simulation packages PVSYST and HOMER to simulate the system performance and to reach the optimum configurations based on the objective criteria. The criteria used in economic optimization are the net present cost and the cost of energy, with the percent of the capacity shortage.

However, rural zones not connected to power grids require more studies related to select low cost and efficient technologies suitable to each size of community. This paper presents a lexicographic multi-objective optimisation model (LMOM) to select the best renewable energy technologies (solar and wind) of hybrid power generation systems (HPGSs) for communities located in non-interconnected zones. The model prioritises objective functions such as the generation cost, emissions of carbon dioxide (CO                             2                             ) and energy consumption in ton-equivalent petroleum (TEP). In addition, the model considers constraints related to the production cost, environmental sustainability, environmental conditions and reliability of the system. The results show that the model provides sustainable HPGSs adapted to the size of each community and the best renewable energy technologies are the central receiver system and the wind turbine with a 20-m tower.                          © 2019, Econjournals.

This paper deals with the development of an innovative energy autonomous system in order to provide drinking water in isolated small communities, using brackish water as feedstock. The case study is a small village in Jordan, where the system that was designed and constructed in Greece, was installed. The unique characteristic of the innovative system is its compact form that incorporates the reverse osmosis unit and the renewable energy production from three sources, wind, solar and water. The energy autonomous system for the production of drinking water from brackish water can be used as a decentralized unit for isolated areas where access to clean water and electricity is not available. © 2014, Balaban Desalination Publications.

It is used in isolated areas for lighting, pumping, etc. However, the extraction of the maximum power generated by a PVG at any moment of the day is a big deal because the characteristic of a PVG in nonlinear which makes the location of the Maximum Power Point (MPP) difficult. Therefore, a Maximum Power Point Tracking technique (MPPT) is required to maximize the output power. In this paper, a photovoltaic water pumping system has been studied. This system consists of three main parts: PVG, a DC-DC boost converter and a DC motor coupled with a centrifugal water pump. We have proposed a new MPPT algorithm based on Fuzzy logic and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to improve the system performances. The ANN is used to predict the optimal voltage of the PVG, under different environmental conditions (temperature and solar irradiance) and the fuzzy controller is used to command the DC-DC boost converter. The proposed method is compared to P&O technic, by simulation under Matlab/Simulink, to verify its effectiveness. © 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Studies of DLR MED-CSP project show that Iran can be a part of the Mediterranean solar power generation chain in 2050 to provide electrical power demand of Europe. High direct solar radiation and available desert lands in Iran are factors to encourage the full development of solar power plants like solar chimney power plants for the thermal and electrical productions of energy for various uses. The interested region is the central region of Iran where solar radiation and global insolation are much better than other areas. However, to evaluate SCPP performance and power generation throughout Iran, 12 different areas across the country are considered. The obtained results clear that solar chimney power plants can produce from 10 to 28 MWh/month of electrical power. This power production is sufficient for the needs of the isolated areas and can even used to feed the grid. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

They have abrupt fronts, lateral ridges that delineate the flanks, and depressed areas extending from the crests of the fronts to the heads. They are composed of blocks and slabby clasts of igneous rock with lengths of 2-3 ft. Isolated areas on the rock-glacier surfaces are covered by an azonal soil of decomposed organic material approximately 6 inches thick.

Such a plant will serve small isolated communities in remote areas devoid of water resources. A specially customized code was built to simulate the operation of the installation in order to allow appropriate choice of components specifications. Site meteorological data were used to enhance prediction capabilities. The code continuously updates the instantaneous water lever of the reservoir as well as the current state of charge of the accumulators. Depending on these two variables, a logical decision tree is built to decide whether the cumulated wind and solar energy production can satisfy the load of the plant or additional energy must be provided from the accumulators or an auxiliary diesel engine generator. The process control system for such an installation must allow for operation in isolated areas where qualified maintenance personnel are scarce or remote. These are special considerations regarding the design philosophy in order to reach a state as close as possible to a maintenance-free system. In view of this consideration, several layers of back-up were built into the system such as a diesel generator (whose use is to be kept to a minimum). Also, the system has been designed to operate at about a 33% service factor. Two-day battery storage autonomy has also been provided. The desalination plant uses reverse osmosis technology. The plant has a maximum product capacity of 9 m3/d in view of future needs, even though it is designed to currently produce only 3 m 3/d. The inlet water is to be provided from on-site brackish water wells. The local water quality is approximately 3500-5000 ppm corresponding to brackish water. The system has been designed based on the premise that the average on-site wind velocity is about 4-5 m/s and an insolation level of about 5-5.5 k Wh/m2/d. The expected life-span of the plant is about 15 years. The system was successfully erected and has been continuously operated producing 3 m3/d. Experimental measurements are now in progress, and a comparison to theoretical predictions is presented. The time schedule for the whole project consisted of 6-8 months, including many changes required during construction.","Demonstration plant; Desalination; Photovoltaics; Reverse osmosis; Wind power","desalination plant; operational experience; reverse osmosis; rural area; solar desalination; wind power; Diesel engines; Meteorology; Osmosis; Photovoltaic cells; Solar equipment; Water resources; Wind power; Brackish water well; Desalination","","","","","","","Buresch M., Photovoltaic Energy Systems, (1983); Duffie J.A., Beckman W.A., Solar Energy Thermal Processes, (1974); Seeling-Hochmuth G.C., Solar Energy, 61, 2, (1997)","D.

Experimental data are sufficient for establishing a statistical correlation between heat extraction and meteorological parameters: insolation, diurnal and nocturnal temperatures. The influences of these parameters are also evaluated through operation analysis. Both approaches are rather consistent. Nocturnal temperature appears to be a quite important factor. Indeed, cold nights (around 10°C) largely increase production. Meteorological conditions for producing either just no ice at all or 5.2 kg, are investigated, as well as an evaluation of yearly production: in Agadir, the average daily production lies around 4 kg/m2. With a nocturnal cooling system, the units would produce around 1 kg more. From the economic point of view, small units such as those tested herein are too expensive, but solarization of a pre-existing cold store in isolated areas looks competitive. © 1992.","","Ice - Manufacture; Meteorology - Effects; Heat Extraction; Solar Powered Ice Makers; Refrigeration","","","","","Moroccan Minist6re de l'Education Nationale; Ministère des Affaires Etrangères, (AI 87-281)","Acknowledgements--This work was supported by Minist6re des Affaires Etrang6res, France, contract No. AI 87-281, with help of Moroccan Minist6re de l'Education Nationale.

To maximize the use of the renewable energy resource, the size and operation of the hybrid system components need to be matched to the load and the available renewable resources. The software (HybridRO), which is suitable for the examination of several types of power supply systems using renewable (solar and wind) and conventional energy sources for a Reverse Osmosis (RO) desalination unit, was used to simulate the performance of a hybrid power supply system to provide the required power to an RO desalination plant. A small community in the south of Iraq is chosen in this study as an example of the small communities that depends on ground water for providing drinking and other essential water needs. The study concluded that the lowest water cost is 1.8$/m3 for RO unit powered by either a diesel generator or by a combination of diesel, wind, and solar power. Relying on renewable energy only increase the water cost to 2.3-2.4$/m3 depending on the source type.

WVN effectiveness can be augmented when coupled with a network of low-power, low-cost Pyroelectric InfraRed (PIR) detectors to form a multimodal surveillance system. Autonomy is a key issue as battery replacement is often impractical and even using energy scavenging techniques, such as solar harvester, ad-hoc power management policies are essential to extend network lifetime. In this paper we propose a cooperative policy to manage power consumption of a WVN powered by solar scavengers and supported by a network of PIR sensors that perform a coarse classification of movements. A cost function is calculated by each VSN according to its available energy and information from the PIR network. Such functions are used by a distributed energy aware policy that selects the best VSN to observe the activity. This VSN locally analyzes the image and detects whether or not it represents a person, and only this information is forwarded to users. The effectiveness of this technique is evaluated through simulation and compared to an approach presented in previous work. Results show an increase in system lifetime without any loss in people detection ratio. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Multimodal Surveillance; Power Aware Design; Pyroelectric InfraRed; Solar Harvester; Wireless Video Sensor Network","Energy harvesting; Energy management; Harvesters; Image coding; Monitoring; Security systems; Sensor networks; Solar energy; Telecommunication networks; Cost functions; Energy efficiency; Energy harvesting; Harvesters; Image coding; Low power electronics; Power management; Power management (telecommunication); Security systems; Sensor networks; Multi-modal; Power-aware design; Pyroelectric InfraRed; Solar Harvester; Wireless video sensor networks; Battery replacements; Coarse classification; Distributed energies; Multi-modal; Power-aware design; Research communities; Surveillance systems; Wireless video sensor networks; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","Boettcher P.W., Shaw G.A., Energy-constrained collaborative processing for target detection, tracking, and geolocation, IPSN 2003, 2634, pp. 254-268, (2003); Brunelli D., Moser C., Benini L., Thiele L., An efficient solar energy harvester for wireless sensor nodes, Proceedings of the Conference on Design, Automation and Test in Europe, (2008); Datcu D., Yang Z., Rothkrantz L.J.M., Multimodal, Multimodal Surveillance: Sensors, Algorithms, and Systems, pp. 311-338, (2007); Dong Q., Maximizing system lifetime in wireless sensor networks, Proceedings of the 4th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, (2005); Esram T., Chapman P., Comparison of photovoltaic array maximum power point tracking techniques, IEEE Transaction on Energy Conversion, 2, pp. 439-449, (2007); Giridhar A., Kumar P.R., Maximizing the functional lifetime of sensor networks, Proceedings of the 4th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, (2005); He T., Vicaire P., Yan T., Cao Q., Zhou G., Gu L., Luo L., Stoleru R., Stankovic J.A., Abdelzaher T.F., Achieving Long-Term Surveillance in Vigilnet, pp. 1-12, (2006); Honeywell Security and Custom Electronic, (2008); Junker H., Lukowicz P., Troster G., Sampling frequency, signal resolution and the accuracy of wearable context recognition systems, ISWC 2004, 3298, pp. 176-177, (2004); Yoshinari M.M.K., A human motion estimation method using 3-successive video frames, Proc. of Int.

Programs, such as feed-in-tariffs (FITs) implemented in many countries for on-grid PV, provide economic incentives for investment. On the other hand, off-grid PV systems reduce energy poverty and increase both entrepreneurial productivity and return in rural isolated areas. Despite these social and economic justifications, there is still limited access to capital and appropriate financing mechanisms for the upfront cost, resulting in the slow uptake of solar PV under government programs, especially for poorer individuals. Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending networks represent an abundant untapped financial resource for accelerating the deployment of PV technology. This paper considers an innovative P2P lending framework for A) financing solar PV on-grid under a FIT program and B) off-grid for a small business, whilst distributing both the environmental and economic advantages throughout the entire population. The requirements and limitations of the proposed funding mechanisms are analyzed and conclusions are drawn.

It accounts for only 3.5 % of the country's primary energy consumption and barely 1 % excluding large hydro. While the Soviet regime encouraged research as early as the 1920s, centralized energy planning policies and the overuse of fossil fuels (Russia is the world's leading oil and gas producer and exporter), put a quick end to this. Renewable energy could, however, meet real needs, by compensating unequal regional access to energy (some devote more than half of their budget to energy), improving supply to isolated areas or, in terms of a sustainable energy policy, to limit fossil fuel consumption. Russia does, in effect, have an extremely vast renewable energy potential (hydro, wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, tidal), which could count for nearly 30 % of its primary energy consumption, particularly important for some regions poorly-endowed with energy resources (Kamtchatka, for example) where renewable energy use could easily become competitive. However, investments will really only develop if the government initiates a support policy by precisely calculating objectives for renewable energy use and financial aid in the form of subsidies or repurchasing prices.","","","","","","","","","Renewables in Russia: From Opportunities to Reality, (2003); Dmitriev G., Wind Energy in Russia, (2001); Renewable Energy Bulletin, plusieurs numéros disponibles sur le site d'Intersolar","","","","","","","","","05900239","","","","French","Cour.

The central Virginia seismic zone, like other seismically active intraplate areas, is a spatially isolated area of persistent, diffuse earthquake activity. We suggested earlier that rainfall plays a key role in the generation of intraplate seismicity (""hydroseismicity""). Observed long-period (10-30 years) changes in streamflow (rainfall) are hypothesized to generate intraplate seismicity by diffusion of pore pressure transients from recharge areas of groundwater basins to depth as deep as the brittle-ductile transition. Streamflow and earthquake strain for a 62-year sample from 1925 to 1987 in the central Virginia seismic zone were cumulated, and a least-squares straight-line fit was subtracted to obtain residuals of streamflow and strain. Residual streamflow was differentiated to obtain the rate of change of residual streamflow. We observed common cyclicities with periods of 10-30 years for residual streamflow and strain. From the one-dimensional diffusion equation, we determined the time response of fluid pressure at depths, ψ, in a hydraulically diffusive crust to an impulsive change in fluid pressure at the surface of a groundwater basin. These responses were convolved with the surface streamflow residuals, or, because of results from reservoir-induced seismicity, with the derivatives of these residuals. Root-mean-square values (rms) of the convolutions were computed for ψ = 5, 10, 15 and 20 km and various values of D. For central Virginia, the number of earthquakes, N, within a crustal slice centered on a depth, ψ, was found to be proportional to the rms value of the convolution, suggesting that the number of intraplate earthquakes generated is directly proportional to the magnitude of the rms changes in fluid pore pressure within the crustal slice. These fluctuations in pore pressure, in concert with stress corrosion and hydrolytic weakening, are hypothesized to trigger intraplate earthquakes in a crust stressed by ridge-push. Crosscorrelation of the residual streamflow convolutions with residual strain, provides a measure of similarity between the streamflow convolution and the strain. Optimum values of crustal diffusivity, D, were considered to be those values for which the Crosscorrelation function looks approximately even. That this occurs only over a reasonable range of diffusivities (near D = 50 km2/year) is consistent with the hypothesized causal relationship between streamflow and intraplate seismicity. Finally, others have shown a clear relationship between the 11-year solar cycle and storm track latitudes in the North Atlantic. Storm tracks over the eastern United States and Canada indicate that north of 50 ° N, the average latitude of storm tracks during December, January, and February is about 2.5 ° farther south at sunspot maximum than at sunspot minimum. A correlation with the 11-year solar cycle was discovered by Labitzke (1987). Significantly, we recognize a clear peak near 11 years in the Fourier spectra of actual (not residual) streamflow in the James River in the central Virginia seismic zone. © 1991.","","USA, Virginia; brittle/ductile transition; intraplate seismicity; pore pressure earthquake; rainfall; streamflow","","","","","","","Biot, General theory of three-dimensional consolidation, J.

In the same way, an important attempt to develop self-sustainable and low environmental impact equipments, with improved performance, can be easily seen nowadays. At this point, an important matter is the supply of electric energy in places where it is unavailable, due to the distance from the power grid, or even in places where the ecosystem is of great importance, preventing the construction of any type of distribution network. One solution, frequently employed in these cases, is the use of internal combustion engine generators or even archaic lampions for illumination, resulting in a high environmental impact, due the burning of fossil fuels and consequently carbon emission. Through Bibliographic and Experimental research, as well as seminars and interactions with specialists of the area, it was possible to develop the idea of a device that fits within the proposed requirements. This paper aims to introduce the idea of a Solar Powered Battery Charger with Self-Oriented Panel, completely independent of a power grid, with efficiency as close as possible to the commercial chargers which, otherwise, depend on an electrical socket to work.","Battery; Charger; Energy; Isolated areas; Para-consistent Logic; Sustainability","","","","","","","","Nogueira M., Engenharia de Software: Um Framework Para A Gestão de Riscos em Projetos de Software, (2009); Da Costa N., Et al., Lógica Paraconsistente Aplicada, (1999); Bursztyn M.A., Difícil Sustentabilidade: Política Energética e Conflitos Ambeintais, (2001); Bermann C., Energia no brasil:Para quê?. para quem, Crise e Alternativas Para Um País Sustentável, (2002); Labetzke M., Solar S.-P., Elektor Eletrônica, Ed., 93-94, pp. 10-11, (2010); Da A.C.C.N., Abe J.M., Paraconsistência em Informática e Inteligência Artificial, (2000); Filho S., Inacio Da J., De M., Aplicações da Lógica Paraconsinstente Anotada (), (1999); Torres C.R., Sistema Inteligente Paraconsistente Para Controle de Robôs Móveis Autônomos, (2004); Angelotti E.S., Utilização da Lógica Paraconsistente Na Implementação de Um Sistema Multi-Agente, (2001); Neto M.C.L., Venson, Nério, Lógica Paraconsistente, (2002)","","","","Ingenierie des Organisations Distribuees (IODE); GDR Macs","International Conference on Advances in Production Management Systems, APMS 2010","11 October 2010 through 13 October 2010","Cernobbio, Como","102693","","978-886493007-7","","","English","Proc.

The absence of a 24-hour basis availability brings forth electricity conversion and storage issues. These factors have led the hybrid power systems to gather increasing interest of R&D studies. Hybrid power systems, those who consists of two or more different type generators, are seen as a way to provide power to remote residences or small communities in the developing world where the costs for large scale expansion of electrical grids is prohibitive and the transportation cost of fossil fuels is also high. The aim of this paper is to examine the feasibility of various hybrid power generation systems covering the electrical needs of a typical family house which is grid independent. The residential load is comprised by certain consumption profiles in heating, cooling, lighting, refrigeration and other appliances. The absence of grid connection in isolated areas together with the economic disadvantages of the enlargement of the grid to these areas, may set off the widest application and utilization of small autonomous hybrid systems. ©2009 IEEE.","Hybrid power systems; Off grid; Photovoltaic systems; Renewable energy sources; Small autonomous systems; Wind power systems","Developing countries; Electric power generation; Electric power measurement; Electric power systems; Fossil fuels; Hybrid systems; Mesh generation; Natural resources; Photovoltaic effects; Solar energy; Wind power; Autonomous systems; Hybrid power systems; Off-grids; Photovoltaic systems; Renewable energy source; Wind power systems; Electric generators","","","","","","","Hybrid Optimization Model for Energy Planning; Panapakidis I.P., Papagiannis G.K., Evaluation of a supply side management and a demand side management policy implemented in the Greek Elector sector, MedPower 2008, Thessaloniki, Greece, November 2008;  Report for the Long-term Energy Planning of Greece, (2007); Shaahid S.M., Elhadidy M.A., Economic analysis of hybrid photovoltaic-diesel-battery power systems for residential loads in hot regions-a step to clean future, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 12, pp. 488-503, (2008); Binopoulos E., Haviaropoulos P., Environmental Impacts of Wind Farms: Myth and Reality, (2006); Chedid R., Akiki H., Rahman S., A decision support technique for the design of hybrid solar wind power systems, IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion, 13, 1, (1998); El-Hefnawi S.H., Photovoltaic diesel-generator-hybrid-power-system-sizing, Renewable Energy, 13, 1, pp. 33-40, (1998); Senjyu T., Hayashi D., Yona A., Urasaki N., Funabashi T., Optimal configuration of power generating systems in isolated island with renewable energy, Renewable Energy, 32, pp. 1917-1933, (2007); Bansal R.C., Bhatti T.S., Kothari D.P., Automatic reactive power control of wind-diesel-micro-hydro autonomous hybrid power systems using ANN tuned static var compensator, IEEE Trans.

Its aim is a better understanding of the attitudes, expectations, and relationship of the users towards the solar home system. The data collected made it possible to make suggestions for adapting the photovoltaic systems to their environment by taking into account social, cultural, and geoclimatic specificities. Analysis of on-site productivity provides valuable information on energy profiles and types of use. Field surveys made it possible to associate users' perception of the energy production equipment and their degree of satisfaction with operating efficiency and on-site maintenance. This aspect is essential for analyzing the actual rate of use of the energy that is theoretically available. Parallel to these surveys, the results of the study carried out on the performance of the solar home systems made it possible to learn the quantitative aspects of the energy produced and consumed as well as the qualitative aspects of the parameters that condition the performance of the photovoltaic systems.

Fresh samples of skin were measured under a solar simulator, taking account of the pigmentation of hair and skin and the structural characteristics of the haircoat (coat thickness, hair diameter, hair length, angle of the hairs to the skin surface, number of hairs per unit area), which defined the average free path length of a photon within the coat, L. White hairs with high L values showed the highest transmission coefficients, while black hairs presented in general very low or even nul transmission. The best protection against UV was given by black hairs with low L values over a black skin. However, because of the heating by absorption of thermal radiation (in a Holstein cow the temperature of the black spots reach 44.1°C at the same time that of the white spots is 37.7°C), the best choice for tropical environments will be a white coat with a low L value over a black skin. This is a combination hardly found in European cattle, however in the present study a Holstein cow was found with isolated areas of white hair over black skin. An alternative choice would be a black coat with a low L value. Red animals presented high UV transmission coefficients through both the coat and the skin, and are not good choices for tropical environments, unless they have also a high pigmented skin.","Cattle; Haircoat; Radiation; Skin; Ultraviolet","","","","","","","","Amakiri S.F., Melanin and DOPA-positive cells in the skin of tropical cattle, Acta Anatomica, 103, pp. 434-444, (1979); Anderson D.E., Genetic aspects of cancer with special reference to cancer of the eye in the bovine, Ann.

Our objective is to guarantee the reliability of the photovoltaic power generation equipments located in remote and isolated areas, including photovoltaic pumping stations, expected to supply water to local people for human consumption and for livestock from drilling isolated. Thus, we are focused particularly on the reliability of these systems and their maintenance in operational mode. The introduction of the e-maintenance can reduce cost and time management of equipment, and provide easy access to relevant information for the user by freeing up geographical constraints. Our study aims to introduce the techniques proposed by the e-Maintenance, to improve the management of the maintenance process. In this project a cooperative distributed platform of e-maintenance is proposed, including data acquisition systems, control, maintenance management, diagnosis assistance, management of documentation, etc. An e-maintenance platform is a collaboration platform offering a set of software components and software services for maintenance support (integrated and/or distant) all enable maintenance actors to find each other, and the information they need, and to be able to communicate and work together to achieve maintenance process. In this platform, the process of the various modules must be designed following a process of knowledge capitalization and data processing to ensure the diagnosis and prognosis of the pumping system of the Photovoltaic system and thus ensure its reliability. This processing chain will be tested in a first time in a mini-solar station to show the feasibility of the approach. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Diagnostic support system; E-maintenance platform; Knowledge based method; Photovoltaic pumping; Renewable energy","","","","","","","","Karray M.H., Morello-Chebel B., Zerhouni N., Towards a maintenance semantic architecture, The Fourth World Congress on; Lebold M., Thurston M., Open standards for condition-based maintenance and prognostic systems,  Annual Maintenance and Reliability Conference (MARCON 2001), (2001); Chebel-Morello B., Rasovska I., Zerhouni N., De Besancon L.A., Knowledge capitalization in system of equipment diagnosis and repair help, Dans IJCAI'2005 Workshop on Knowledge Management and Organizational Memories, 55; Rasovska I., Chebel-Morello B., Zerhouni N., A conceptual model of maintenance process in unified modelling language,  Symposium on Information Control Problems in Manufacturing, INCOM'2004, (2004); Grundstein M., Management des Connaissances de L'entreprise: Problématique, Axe de Progrès, Orientations, Research Report, (2000); Wielinga B., Van De Velde W., Schreiber G., Akkermans H., Towards a unification of knowledge modelling approaches, Second Generation Experts Systems, pp. 299-335, (1993)","","","Elsevier BV","","Terragreen 2012: Clean Energy Solutions for Sustainable Environment, CESSE 2012","16 February 2012 through 18 February 2012","Beirut","103428","18766102","978-162748427-5","","","English","Energy Procedia","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84873600879"

Inclined metallic surfaces covered with a cotton fabric and placed one over the other in a box are used. The cold salty water is fed only in the upper stage and flows along each surface, falling from one stage to the next by gravity, reaching finally a heated tray at the bottom. Vapour condenses below each surface and produces the water evaporation in the upper side of the same surface. Experiments have been performed with a prototype and the results are discussed and compared with the values obtained from a computational model. The model is used to evaluate the effect of changes in different system parameters. A small unit to be used by families in isolated areas is described. © 1994.","","Desalination; Distillation; Multistage; Solar Power; Computational methods; Condensation; Evaporation; Mathematical models; Solar collectors; Systems analysis; Passive atmospheric multiple effect distillation unit; Distillation equipment","","","","","ConsejoN acionald e InvestigacioneCsie nt-ificasy T6cnicas","AcknowledgementTsh e presenwt ork was supportedb y a grant from the ConsejoN acionald e InvestigacioneCsie nt-ificasy T6cnicas(C ONICET) from ArgentinaW. eappreciate the discussionhse ldwith the memberosf DistillationP roject working under the SubprogramV I of the CYTED-D Co-operationp rograma mongIb eroamericaCno untries.","Sastre, de Wilde, Varillas, de Courtade, Aguilera, [The publication and its commitment to the society]., Rev Med Inst Mex Seguro Soc, (1990); Howe, Tleimat, Fundamental of water desalination, Solar Energy Engineering, pp. 431-498, (1977); Hodges, Et al., Solar distillation utilising multiple-effect humidification, Office of Saline Water, U.S. Department of the Interior, Res. and Dev.

Managing remote PV installations requires good communication and definition of responsibilities between the designers, manufacturers, and field installation personnel. An efficient and quality installation effort can also contribute to the acceptance, understanding, and support of a system by the user. Achieving this requires an attention to detail and planning not usually found in domestic application work.

The first describes hydrogen production from electrolysis water depending on the DC output current of the photovoltaic (PV) energy source. The second part presents the utilization of produced hydrogen to generate electric power. The design of a closed loop cycle for electrolyzer and fuel cell to produce hydrogen and generate electrical energy, respectively, depending on a renewable energy source, is considered. Five different types of electrolyzer and fuel cells are studied to depict the effect of these types with respect to the current, voltage, cell temperature, cell pressure, sizing, and the required number of modules to produce one cubic meter of hydrogen per one hour. According to the various types of electrolyzer and fuel cell, multi PV systems are designed to produce 10 m3/day of hydrogen. The daily PV solar energy consumption to produce 10 m3 of hydrogen gas is calculated. Also, I-V and P-V characteristics of PV arrays for different percentages of insolation for the selected isolated area (Aswan) are calculated. The results show that the first type of electrolyzer (conventional alkaline) is the most economical one to produce hydrogen gas at the lowest values of the electrical current and voltage. The first and the second types of the fuel cells (alkaline & polymer membrane) generate a higher value of electrical energy than the others.

This paper investigates the potentiality of a wind turbine generator (WTG) and a photovoltaic generator (PVG) as competing candidates in a generation mix of an isolated area. The investigation considers two basic aspects of generation expansion analysis: reliability and cost. The WTG, at its present status related to cost and also at its possible future status, is compared with the conventional thermal unit. Similar investigation is made in the paper for the PVG. Unlike many attempts in the past, the temperature dependent probabilistic models of WTGs and PVGs are developed for the evaluation of reliability and cost. The paper also shows an application of temperature dependent probabilistic models of WTGs and PVGs in generation expansion analysis. © 1995.","","","","","","","","","Ahsan, Schenk, Two area production cost evaluation by the segmentation method, IEEE Trans.

The objective is to design a 2 kW refrigeration equipment for isolated areas with a high level of solar radiation to meet refrigeration requirements. The equipment has been designed to operate with a concentrating solar power system to obtain the required temperatures. The heat exchangers, which act as condensers, as well as the absorber and evaporator, are all made of galvanized steel piping having fins. The design uses natural convection; the generator and energy-saving heat exchanger have a multi-tubular arrangement and a transfer tank is used in place of a pump for displacing the ammonia solution. All of the operations are manually controlled. Overall, the test results showed unsatisfactory operation of the equipment having low efficiency. Nevertheless, the proposed objectives have been met and it is evident that with several important modifications the equipment will operate satisfactorily. In conclusion, based on the development phase, it is apparent that future prototypes must be more compact and more efficient. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

For the wind power generation branch, a new doubly excited permanent-magnet brushless machine is used to capture the maximum wind power by using online flux control.

The electrification of homes and farms in rural areas by using PV systems would contribute to improving the inhabitants' social, economic and cultural standard. In Romania, it is estimated that there are about 10,000 homes, farms and schools located in more than 500 settlements which could be electrified by using PV systems. The individual solar home systems would allow each user to adjust his own electricity consumption according to weather variations. A major problem in the development of these systems is the identification of the optimum technical and economic solutions as well as of the main financing sources. The paper aims to present the technical, economic and social problems involved by the implementation of such a project of PV-based electrification in Romania, presenting the particular case of two settlements (Scarisoara and Prisacina) located in the Cerna Valley - the Banat Mountains. © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The LDMEF consists of a pair of outdoor electromagnetically isolated areas, one under the influence of microwave irradiation with a 500 W magnetron and one without microwave irradiation. The growth rates of plants in both areas were compared and evaluated with the experimental data for the temperature distribution in the soil and power distribution of microwave. Although any appreciable influence of microwave was not noticed in the power density less than 10 mW/cm2, the experimental results showed a significant growth rate enhancement when the power density became over 10 mW/cm2. However, the growth was rather depressed when the power density increased over 15 mW/cm2. These effects are well explained by the temperature and moisture in the soil which are also under an appreciable influence of microwave irradiation [1,2]. In this context, we newly constructed an indoor irradiation facility, in which the growth conditions of plants under a constant soil temperature can be maintained. In addition, irradiation with a 5.8 GHz magnetron will be conducted in the new facility. In parallel to a series of indoor and outdoor irradiation tests on plants, the influence of microwave irradiation on the growth pattern of albino mouse will be conducted. This experiment will be the first experimental evaluation for the influence of microwave irradiation on animals.","","Electromagnetic shielding; Environmental impact; Growth kinetics; Health risks; Plants (botany); Satellites; Solar energy; Temperature distribution; Growth rates; Long duration microwave exposure facility (LDMEF); Microwave irradiation; Solar power satellites (SPS); Microwaves","","","","","","","Murakami H., Komiyama K., Kato Y., Kudo I., Recent progress in long-duration microwave exposure facility, 52nd International Astronautical Congress, (2001); Murakami H., Komiyama K., Kato Y., Kudo I., Long-duration microwave exposure facility, 22nd ISAS Space Energy Symposium, pp. 46-50, (2003); Kamimura Y., Saito K., Saiga T., Amemiya Y., Effect of microwave irradiation on monkey, IEICE Trans. on Commun., E77-B, pp. 762-765, (1994); Saito K., Saiga T., Suzuki K., Reversible irritative effect of acute 2.45 GHz microwave exposure on rabbit eyes - A preliminary evaluation, The Journal of Toxicological Sciences, 23, pp. 197-203, (1998)","H.

The problem of tracking the maximum power point for charging solar batteries is considered. In the literature, there are several techniques for the research of the point corresponding to the maximum power delivered by the panels. The optimal operating point of the PV systems is estimated by linear approximations. These approximations reduce considerably the performances of the PV systems. In this work, we are interested in the modelling of the photovoltaic system. To prove a validation of the system model, we proceed to a simulating in Matlab/Simulink software environment of this system. Both simulation and experimental results are presented. From those results, the models obtained coincide with reality and can be employed for the development of the control algorithms.","Battery charger; Boost converter; Mppt; Photovoltaic system","Charging (batteries); Electric converters; Model structures; Photovoltaic effects; Simulators; Solar radiation; Thermoelectricity; Battery charger; Boost converter; Control algorithms; Isolated areas; Linear approximations; Matlab/Simulink software; Maximum power; Maximum power point; Modelling and simulations; Mppt; Optimal operating point; Photovoltaic system; Photovoltaic systems; PV system; Solar battery; System models; Solar energy","","","","","","","Arrouf M., Ghabrour S., Modelling and simulation of a pumping system fed by photovoltaic generator within the Matlab/Simulink programming environment, Desalination, 209, pp. 23-30, (2007); Yu G.J., Jung Y.S., Choi J.Y., Kim G.S., A novel two-mode MPPT control algorithm based on comparative study of existing algorithms, Science Direct, 76, pp. 455-463, (2004); Hohm D.P., Ropp M.E., Comparative study of maximum power point tracking algorithm,  IEEE photovoltaic specialists conference, pp. 1699-1702, (2000); Milosevic M., et all, Decoupling current control and maximum power point control in small power network with photovoltaic source, Power System Conference and Exposition PSCE'06, pp. 1005-1011, (2006); Buhler H., Convertisseur Statique, Presse Polytechnique Ramande, (1991); Geoffrey G.R., Paul C.S., Cascaded DC-DC converter connection of photovoltaic modules, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 19, 4, pp. 1130-1139, (2004); Balog R., low cost fuel cell inverter Non-linear techniques for control of boost, (2001); Walker G.R., Evaluating MPPT converter topologies using a Matlab PV model, Electrical and Electronics Engineering, 21, 1, pp. 49-56, (2001); Santos J.L., Antunes F.L.M., Maximum power point tracker for PV systems, World Climate and Energy Event, (2003)","","","","","","","","","12595985","","MMAEE","","English","Modell Meas Control A","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-67649209937"

Currently, the main technologies that provide electric power to these communities are diesel generators. This non-renewable energy source, besides causing serious problems to the environment and human health, have high maintenance and operational costs. This paper presents a study on the use of photovoltaic and fuel cells for continuous supply of electric power. The paper outlines the technical and costs characteristics of a pilot project set up in an environmental protection area, located in the state of Tocantins, Brazil. The pilot project uses solar energy as the primary electric power production source. Surplus energy stored in the hydrogen produced by the electrolysis of water is later transformed into electric power by the fuel cells during periods when there is little or no sunlight. A comparative study between the technologies and potential configurations meeting the needs of isolated communities in the Amazon through simulations based on HOMER software are presented.

This paper proposes that the suitable alternative solution of grid power is the stand-alone PV/wind hybrid energy system with diesel generator as a backup for cellular mobile telephony base station site in isolated areas. It is expected that the newly developed and installed system would provide very good opportunities for mobile telephony base station in near future. In addition, protecting the environment and combating climate change are two of the most pressing challenges facing humankind. As energy prices soar, network operators are increasingly scrutinizing their environmental and social responsibilities. This system will be more cost effective and environmental friendly over the conventional diesel generator. Approximately 70-80% fuel cost over conventional diesel generator and the emission of CO2 and other harmful gasses in environments were reduced. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

One goal is to reduce operational costs in terms of fulfilling the missions and maintaining safe human operations in unfriendly environments. Other goals, imbedded in the demonstrator's design, are: mobility, lowered energy consumption, the usage of ecological energy, and an increased energetic independence. These characteristics would allow the development of a class of robots that may be used in unfriendly and isolated areas, in which solar energy is adequate. Yet another goal is to develop a database documenting how the demonstrator operates under various conditions. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","autonomous vehicle; mobility; photovoltaic cells; Robot; rolling resistance; traction","Carrier mobility; Electric traction; Energy utilization; Information science; Photovoltaic cells; Photovoltaic effects; Robots; Rolling resistance; Autonomous robot; Autonomous Vehicles; Isolated areas; Operational costs; Operational platforms; Photovoltaic panels; Robot chassis; Robotics","","","","","","","Ciobotaru T., Grigore L., Soloi A., Vinturi V., Robot to Combat Terrorist - ROBTER (In Romanian), (2006); Grigore L., Ciobotaru T., Vinturi V., AMMA-2007120- Specific aspects of the stability of platforms used by medium size mobile robots, International Congress Automotive, Environment and Farm Machinery, AMM 2007, October 11-13, Cluj-Napoca, România (2007); Bekker M.G., Theory of Land Locomotion, (1956); Wong J.Y., Theory of Ground Vehicle, (1993); Janosi Z., Hanamoto B., The analytical determination of drawbar pull as a function of slip for tracked vehicles in deformable soils, Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on the Mechanics of Soil-Vehicle Systems, Edizioni Minerva Tecnica, Torino, Italy (1961); Wong J.Y., On the Role of Mean Maximum Pressure As An Indicator of Cross-Country Mobility for Tracked Vehicles, Journal of Terramechanics, 31, 3, pp. 197-213, (1994); Laughery S., Gerhart G., Goetz R., Bekker's Terramechanics Model for Off-road Vehicle Research; Lever J.H., Ray L.R., Streeter A., Mobility and Power Budget for A Solar-Powered Polar Rover; Ciobotaru T., Vinturi V., Gh A., Gherman L., Testing Vehicles (In Romanian), (2009); Nise N.S., Control Systems Engineering, (2009); Sandu C., Worley M., Morgan J.B., Experimental Study on the Contact Patch Pressure and Sinkage Analysis of a Lightweight Vehicle on Sand, Journal of Terramechanics, (2011); Sandu C., Sandu A., Ahmadian M., Modeling Multi body Dynamic Systems with Uncertainties.

The situation is driven mostly by the absence of electricity infrastructure in most of the developing countries particularly in rural communities. A number of developing countries are now encouraging the use of solar home systems in isolated areas. Botswana is not immune to this trend. Consequently, available evidence puts the overall contribution of solar energy to primary energy supply in Botswana to less than 1%. A plethora of factors are responsible for inhibiting rapid development of solar home systems in isolated areas in Botswana. Some major impediments often cited as causing low use of solar home systems by rural communities in Botswana include, among others, the following:(i)Low-income status of most rural inhabitants.(ii)Migration of house-owners from village status to lands, or cattle posts. This paper, therefore, analyses factors that impede the rapid development of photovoltaics power generation systems in rural environments in Botswana. The analysis is based on photovoltaic power generation pilot project which was carried out in three (3) villages in Botswana, namely Kudumatse, Lorolwana and Motlhabaneng. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The MRoI is a simple realization of the magnetic environment in the photosphere, reflecting the distance required to balance the integrated magnetic field contained in any magnetogram pixel. It provides a new perspective on where subterrestrial field lines in a Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) model connect to the photosphere, and thus the source of Earth-directed solar wind (within the limitations of PFSS models), something that is not usually obvious from a regular synoptic magnetogram. In each of three sample solar rotations, at different phases of the solar cycle, the PFSS footpoint either jumps between isolated areas of high MRoI or moves slowly within one such area. Footpoint motions are consistent with Fisk's interchange reconnection model. © 2009. The American Astronomical Society.

However, each individual PV system usually supplies energy only to one consumer. In such a case we have several consumers that each one of them uses a stand-alone PV system. This situation would expose such stand-alone systems to transient excessive loads larger than the power generated by the PVs, and then the battery is bound to discharge even during the day. For overcoming this problem, we suggest an autonomous centralized PV system, comprising one battery bank and plural subsystems connected to each other. From solar radiation data and load profiles, the performance of the PV centralized system is simulated by using a time step scheme. The advantages of this system are found to be the large charging rate of power, high efficiency, and low cost compared with conventional individual PV systems and hybrid systems. In addition, the economic study shows that the life cycle cost and the price of kilowatt hour generated in the centralized system is lower than that for the individual systems. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

They have been used to solve complicated practical problems in various areas and are becoming popular more and more nowadays. AI techniques have the following features: can learn from examples; are fault tolerant in the sense that they are able to handle noise and incomplete data; are able to deal with non-linear problems; and once trained can perform prediction and generalization at high speed. AI-based systems are being developed and deployed worldwide in a myriad of applications, mainly because of their symbolic reasoning, flexibility and explanation capabilities. AI have been used and applied in different sectors, such as engineering, economic, medicine, military, marine, etc. They have also been applied for modeling, identification, optimization, prediction, forecasting, and control of complex systems. The main objective of this paper is to present an overview of the alternative approach and AI techniques for modeling and forecasting of meteorological data. Published literature works presented in this paper show the potential of AI as a design tool for prediction and forecasting of meteorological data, these includes, solar radiation, mean temperature, wind speed, humidity, cleanness index, etc. Additionally the advantage of using an AI-based prediction meteorological data in isolated areas where there no instrument for the measurement of this data, especially the parameters related to PV-systems such as solar radiation data. A new intelligent hardware based on neural network and FPGA (Filed Programming Gate Array) implementation is proposed for estimating solar radiation from air temperature and sunshine duration. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Supplying the electricity required for the operation of a monitoring station can be done in two ways: stored energy is carried on-site (fuel, battery), or energy is harvested from the environment and converted to an electrical current.

Simulation of energy sources, energy transducers, power converters, storage devices, and components of the monitoring station is employed for component sizing and for testing worst-case scenarios. As the availability of each energy source is dependent on the geographic location, data from specialized meteorological databases is used as input for the simulator. ©2010 IEEE.","Aeroelastic flutter generator; Arctic; Energy harvesting; Simulator; Solar panel","Aeroelasticity; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electricity; Energy conservation; Flutter (aerodynamics); Harvesting; Simulators; Smart power grids; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Aeroelastic flutter; Arctic; Attractive solutions; Component sizing; Electrical current; Energy source; Energy transducers; Geographic location; Isolated areas; Monitoring stations; Solar panels; Storage devices; Stored energy; Worst case scenario; Energy harvesting","","","","","","","Scrosati B., Challenge of portable power, Nature, 373, pp. 557-558, (1995); Alper J., The Battery: Not Yet a Terminal Case, Science, 296, (2002); Humdinger Wind Energy, (2009); Small Turbines (50-600W), (2000); Pimentel D., Musilek P., Knight A., Heckenbergerova J., Characterization of a Wind Flutter Generator, Ninth International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering, Prague, 2010; Lailler P., Sarrau J.-F., Sarrazin C., Comparative study for '36 V' vehicle applications: Advantages of lead-acid batteries, Journal of Power Sources, 95, pp. 58-67, (2001); Mennicucci D.F., Photovoltaic Array Simulation Models, Solar Cells, 18, pp. 383-392, (1986); Perez R., Ineichen P., Seals R., Michalsky J., Stewart R., Modeling daylight availability and irradiance components from direct and global irradiance, Solar Energy, 44, pp. 271-289, (1990); Perez R., Seals R., Ineichen P., Stewart R., Menicucci D., A new simplified version of the perez diffuse irradiance model for tilted surfaces, Solar Energy, 39, pp. 221-231, (1987); Shao H., Tsui C.Y., Ki W.H., A micro power management system and maximum output power control for solar energy harvesting applications, Proceedings of the International Symposium on Low Power Design, pp. 298-303, (2007); Yi J., Su F., Lam Y.H., Ki W.H., Tsui C.Y., An energy-adaptive MPPT power management unit for micro-power vibration energy harvesting, Proceedings - IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2008, pp. 2570-2573; National Climate Data and Information Archive, (2010); National Solar Radiation Data Base; Ross M., Estimating Wintertime Battery Temperature in Stand-Alone Photovoltaic Systems with Insulated Battery Enclosures, Renewable Energy Technologies in Cold Climates, pp. 344-350, (1998)","D.

A database of total solar radiation data for 60 sites in Algeria has been used to determine the iso-reliability curves of a PVS system (CA, CS) for each site. Initially, the GA is used for determining the optimal coefficient (CAop, CSop) for each site by minimising the optimal cost (objective function). These coefficients allow the determination of the number of PV modules and the capacity of the battery. Subsequently, an ANFIS is used for the prediction of the optimal coefficient in remote areas based only on geographical coordinates. Therefore, 56 couples of CAop and CSop have been used for the training of the network and four couples have been used for testing and validation of the proposed technique. The simulation results have been analysed and compared with the alternative techniques. The technique has been applied and tested for Algeria locations, but it can be generalised for any location in the world.","ANFIS; Genetic algorithm; Photovoltaic; Sizing system","Africa; Algeria; North Africa; Adaptive algorithms; Adaptive systems; Algorithms; Bioelectric phenomena; Boolean functions; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power systems; Fuzzy inference; Genetic algorithms; Inference engines; Solar energy; Solar system; Sun; database; energy resource; fuzzy mathematics; genetic algorithm; optimization; photovoltaic system; reliability analysis; solar power; solar radiation; Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference; Algeria (country); Genetic algorithm (GA); Isolated areas; Neuro fuzzy (NF); Optimal sizing; Photovoltaic (PV); Photovoltaic power supply; Remote areas; Fuzzy logic","","","","","","","Athanasia Lazou A., Anastassios Papatsoris D., The economics of photovoltaic stand-alone residential households: A case study for various European and Mediterranean locations, 62, pp. 411-427, (2000); Boyle G., (1996); Egido M., Lorenzo E., The sizing of stand-alone PV-systems: A review and a proposed new method, 26, pp. 51-69, (1992); Gordon J.M., Optimal sizing of stand-alone photovoltaic solar power systems, 20, pp. 295-313, (1987); Haas A., The value of photovoltaic electricity for society, 54, pp. 25-31, (1995); Holland J.H., (1975); Hontoria L., Aguilera J., Zufiria P., A new approach for sizing stand-alone photovoltaic systems based in neural networks, 78, pp. 313-319, (2005); Jang J.R.S., ANFIS: Adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference systems, 23, 3, pp. 665-684, (1993); Lasnier F., GanAng T., Hilger A., (1990); Markvart T., Fragaki A., Ross J.N., PV system sizing using observed time series of solar radiation, 80, pp. 46-50, (2006); Mellit A., (2006); Mellit A., Artificial intelligence based-modelling for sizing of a stand-alone photovoltaic power system: Proposition for a new model using neuro-fuzzy system (ANFIS), Proceedings of the 3rd IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Systems, pp. 605-611, (2006); Mellit A., ANFIS-based genetic algorithm for predicting the optimal sizing coefficient of photovoltaic supply (PVS) systems, Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Thermal Engineering: Theory and Applications, pp. 97-102, (2007); Mellit A., Kalogirou S.A., Application of neural networks and genetic algorithms for predicting the optimal sizing coefficient of photovoltaic supply (PVS) systems, Proceedings of the World Renewable Energy Congress IX and Exhibition, (2006); Mellit A., Et al., Modelling of sizing the photovoltaic system parameters using artificial neural network, Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Control Application, 1, pp. 353-357, (2003); Mellit A., Et al., Sizing the stand-alone photovoltaic systems using the neural networks adaptive model, Proceedings of the 8th Arab International Solar Energy Conference and the World Renewable Energy Congress, (2004); Mellit A., Et al., Identification and modelling of the optimal sizing combination of stand-alone photovoltaic systems using the radial basis function network, Proceedings of WREC VIII, (2004); Mellit A., Et al., Neural network adaptive wavelets for sizing of stand-alone photovoltaic systems, 1, pp. 365-370, (2004); Mellit A., Et al., An adaptive artificial neural network model for sizing of stand-alone photovoltaic system: Application for isolated sites in Algeria, 80, 10, pp. 1501-1524, (2005); Mellit A., Et al., A simplified model for generating sequence of daily global solar radiation data: Using artificial neural network and a library of Markov transition matrices, 79, 5, pp. 468-482, (2005); Notton G., Et al., Autonomous photovoltaic systems: Influences of some parameters on the sizing: Simulation time step, input and output power profile, 7, pp. 353-369, (1996)","","","","","","","","","1478646X","","","","English","Int.

Solar electricity systems can represent a cost-effective alternative to high cost, conventional, diesel-fired generators, particularly in developing countries where most of the population lives in rural and isolated areas. However, the lack of simple but accurate analytic design tools currently results in either (a) significant, wasteful oversizing or (b) extremely high design costs for one-of-a-kind projects. The analytic solutions discussed here can bring the price of stand-alone photovoltaic systems to economic viabilty at today's hardware and fuel prices, and can also enable local designers in developing countries to design these systems economically and on their own. The analytic models are based on the theory of stochastic processes, and stem from analyses originally developed for analogous water reservoir, queueing and insurance risk problems. © 1987.","","PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS - Costs; COST-EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE; OPTIMAL SIZING; PHOTOVOLTAIC POWER GENERATION; SOLAR ELECTRICITY; STAND-ALONE PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS; SOLAR POWER PLANTS","","","","","","","Bifano, Economic viability of photovoltaic power for development assistance applications, Proc. 16th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists' Conf., (1982); Bifano, Et al., Status of DOE and AID stand-alone photovoltaic system field tests, Proc. 17th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists' Conf., (1984); DeLombard, Everson, A photovoltaic power system and a low-power satellite earth station for Indonesia, Proc. 18th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists' Conf., (1985); Ratajczak, Workshop on Solar Applications in Remote Locations, Photovoltaic systems in remote locations — an experience summary, (1985); Ratajczak, Photovoltaic-powered vaccine refrigeration-freezer systems field test results, N.A.S.A.

The topic is of particular interest, especially for countries located within the Southern Mediterranean belt, generally characterized with vast arid and isolated areas having practically no access to electric power from the national grid. Economic factors being one of the main barriers to diffusion of solar devices so far, an attempt has been made to estimate the water production cost for two different seawater desalination systems: reverse osmosis and multiple effect, powered by a solar thermal and a photovoltaic field, respectively. The results obtained for plants of capacity varying between 500 and 5000 m3/d have been compared to results concerning a conventional desalination system.

Of this incident energy 30% is reflected to space, 45% absorbed, converted into heat and returned to space as IR radiation, 22% contribute to evaporation, 2% to the kinetic energy of winds, 0.06% to photosynthesis, and 0.02% to renewable geothermal energy. Solar energy can be used as thermal energy or as electricity. Although the cost of photovoltaic electricity is much higher, by a factor typically of the order of 10, than that obtained using fossil fuels or nuclear energy, the prices are decreasing. Despite this, it is an especially interesting energy for isolated areas for which it otherwise would be necessary to invest in kilometers of electrical power lines at FF ~ 200,000-400,000/km. In 1997, there was a 43% increase in production of photovoltaic modules. In Europe, Germany, and The Netherlands have stimulated photovoltaics so that there has been a 56% increase in photovoltaics in Europe. Photovoltaics are reliable, modular, low in operating cost, and non-polluting.

A common practice is to combine wind and solar PV energies in the so called hybrid renewable systems. Due to the long distance, and difficult access the overall system used in these applications must be reliable. And the reliability of the system, specially the inverter used to regulate the AC voltage, is one of the main problems associated to these systems, and is responsible for the lack of confidence in renewable systems at several locations in Brazil. This paper shows the initial results of using renewable hybrid systems specially designed for isolated areas, focusing attention on reliability, efficiency and expansion flexibility. It presents the system description, mode of operation, inverter design, and experimental results measured in a pilot plant located in Lençôis Island, a small isolated community in the northeast region of Brazil. © 2009 IEEE.","Hybrid renewable energy systemst; Inerters; Solar energy; Wind energy","Electric grounding; Hybrid computers; Hybrid systems; Pilot plants; Power electronics; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Ac voltage; Energy source; Expansion flexibility; Generation systems; Hybrid renewable energy systemst; Isolated areas; Isolated community; Long distances; Mode of operations; Northeast regions; Renewable energies; Solar PVs; Standalone applications; System description; Wind energy; Wind power","","","","","","","Senjyu T., Nakaji T., Uezato K., Funabashi T., A hybrid power system using alternative energy facilities in isolated Island, IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion, 20, 2, (2005); Ahmed N.A., Miyatake M., A stand-alone hybrid generation system combining solar photovoltaic and wind turbine with simple maximum power point tracking control, Conf Rec.

Nevertheless, since many arid regions are coastal areas, seawater desalination is a reasonable alternative. On the other hand, the energy requirements of desalination processes are high. Then, the energy supply in low development countries or isolated areas may be a problem, especially if electricity is required. Since most arid regions have high renewable energy resources, the use of renewable energies in seawater desalination exhibits an interesting chance, or even the only way to offer a secure source of fresh water. The status and perspectives of development of coupling renewable energy systems with desalination units are reviewed. It is pointed out that there are place of development even for such technologies that seem to be the most mature ones. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","","Desalination; future prospect; power supply;

The objective will be to open previously isolated areas of the Solar System for robotic exploration as early as 2013. The new NASA nuclear power initiative is likely also to benefit military space operations and spur technology innovation by space contractors. The nuclear power initiative comes as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Dawn mission, equipped with revolutionary solar electric ion propulsion, is beginning its eight-year, 3-billion-mile journey to the asteroid belt where it will orbit the infant planets Vesta and Ceres. The International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) sees this as a way to develop technologies for future manned Mars exploration without development of a lunar base. The program also aims at encouraging the formation of mission design teams and beginning the discussion of necessary engineering trades.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00052175","","AWSTA","","English","Aviat.

Hydro, wind and solar power represent some of the technologies which had significant improvement. Among these technologies, micro hydro power stations with self-excited induction generators (IG) became an excellent choice for limited power generation in isolated areas, due basically to its robustness and low cost, compared to synchronous machine. This paper describes the controllers for micro hydro power stations for island operation based on nonlinear model of hydraulic turbine with a self-excited induction generators. Frequency control is obtained by a speed governor applied to the turbine feed system while constant voltage control is reached through reactive power control using a voltage source inverter (VSI). In order to reach effective frequency control, it is proposed the use of a motor flux estimation algorithm to obtain the measurement of instantaneous rotor speed without using a mechanical sensor applied on his shaft resulting in inherent cost reduction. Simulation results are given and they illustrate the transient behavior due step changes in load and frequency reference setting point. © 2011 IEEE.","","Asynchronous generators; Cost reduction; Energy conversion; Frequency estimation; Hydraulic machinery; Hydraulic motors; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Innovation; Power plants; Reactive power; Solar energy; Synchronous machinery; Turbines; Constant voltage control; Feed systems; Frequency reference; Island operation; Isolated areas; Low costs; Mechanical sensors; Micro hydro power; Microgeneration; Modeling and control; Motor flux; Non-linear model; Rotor speed; Self excited induction generators; Speed governors; Step changes; Synchronous machine; Transient behavior; Voltage source inverter; Wind and solar power; Behavioral research","","","","","","","Chapallaz J.-M., Dos Ghali J., Eichenberger P., Fischer G., Manual on Induction Motors Used As Generators, (1992); Machado R.Q., Buso S., Pomilio J.A., Electronically controlled bi-directional connection of induction generator with a single-phase grid, IEEE Industrial Electronics Society Conference IECON 2001, 3, pp. 1982-1987, (2001); Chauhan Y.K., Jain S.K., Singh B., A Prospective on Voltage Regulation of Self-Excited Induction Generators for Industry Applications, IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 46, 2, pp. 720-730, (2010); Chen W.L., Hsu Y.Y., Experimental Evaluation of an Isolated Induction Generator with Voltage and Frequency Control, IEEE 2006 International Symposium on Power Electronics, Electrical Drives, Automation and Motion, 2006, pp. 497-502; Marra E.G., Pomilio J.A., Induction-Generator-Based System Providing Regulated Voltage with Constant Frequency, IEEE Transaction on Industrial Electronics, 47, 4, pp. 908-914, (2000); Singh B., Murthy S.S., Gupta S., Analysis and design of electronic load controller for self-excited induction generators, IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion, 21, 1, pp. 285-293, (2006); Hydraulic Turbine and Turbine Control Models for System Dynamic Studies, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 7, 1, pp. 167-179, (1992); Kundur P., Power System Stability and Control, (1994); Bjornstedt J., Samuelsson O., Voltage and Frequency Control for Island Operated Induction Generators, CIRED Seminar 2008: SmartGrids for Distribution, 2008, pp. 1-4; Hu J., Wu B., New Integration Algorithms for Estimating Motor Flux over a Wide Speed Range, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 13, 5, pp. 969-977, (1998); Wang G., Xu D., Yu Y., Chen W., Improved Rotor Flux Estimation Based on Voltage Model for Sensorless Field-Oriented Controlled Induction Motor Drives, IEEE 2008 Power Electronics Specilists Conference, 2008, pp. 1887-1890; Zhao K., You X., Speed Estimation of Induction Motor Using Modified Voltage Model Flux Estimation, IEEE 2009 International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference, 2009, pp. 1979-1982; Rech C., De Camargo R.F., De Campos M., Salvadori F., Leandro G.V., Bolacell J.C.O., Performance Analysis of Synchronization Methods for Self-Excited Induction Generators, IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference PESC 2008, pp. 3378-3384, (2008)","L.
